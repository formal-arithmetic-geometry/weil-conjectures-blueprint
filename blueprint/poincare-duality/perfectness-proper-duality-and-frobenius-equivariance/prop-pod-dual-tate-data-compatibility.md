In the Poincare duality conventions of this chapter (the fixed setting), strict Weil complex with $K$ perfect. The datum $\varphi _{K^\vee }$ of Definition 9.28 defines a strict Weil complex $(K^\vee ,\varphi _{K^\vee })$, the coefficient evaluation

$$
K\otimes ^L_{A_X}K^\vee \xrightarrow {\  \operatorname {ev}_K\  }A_X
$$

is a morphism of Weil objects, the twisted object $(K^\vee (r),\varphi _{K^\vee (r)})$ is a strict Weil complex, and the canonical identification $\mathbb D_XK\cong K^\vee (d)[2d]$ of Proposition 9.16 is an isomorphism of Weil objects (the compatibility of the purity isomorphism with the geometric-Frobenius data is the Weil equivariance of purity and trace, [thm-pur-weil-equivariance-of-purity-and-trace], in [smooth-purity], and the duality isomorphisms are morphisms of Weil complexes by Proposition 1.48). All these objects and morphisms commute with finite reduction, adic normalization, rationalization, finite coefficient-field extension, and idempotent splitting.

## Proof

Step 1: $\varphi _{K^\vee }$ is a genuine Weil datum, i.e. a typed isomorphism of the displayed source and target. The first arrow of the composite in [def-pod-dual-tate-datum] is the canonical isomorphism

$$
Lg_\gamma ^*R\mathcal Hom_X(K,A_X) \xrightarrow {\  \sim \  } R\mathcal Hom_X\bigl(Lg_\gamma ^*K,Lg_\gamma ^*A_X\bigr),
$$

the derived internal Hom under the pullback along the geometric-Frobenius automorphism of [def-trf-scheme-frobenius], which is an isomorphism by the exactness of the pullback along an automorphism and the functoriality of the internal Hom, recorded in [def-weil-derived-pullback-tensor-hom]; the second arrow is induced by the canonical datum $\varphi _A$ on the constant object, the canonical structure of [def-weil-weil-sheaf-complex]; and the third by $\varphi _K^{-1}$. Each is an isomorphism, hence so is the composite, and it is a structure map of one object $K^\vee$, so $(K^\vee ,\varphi _{K^\vee })\in D^b_{ctf,\mathrm W}(X,A)$ by the definition of the strict Weil complex of [def-trf-strict-weil-complex]. Step 2: the evaluation is equivariant. The evaluation is the counit of the tensor–internal-Hom adjunction of [def-weil-derived-tensor], whose unit–counit identity is natural; the definition of $\varphi _{K^\vee }$ is precisely the typed iso making the square

$$
\begin{array}{ccc} Lg_\gamma ^*\bigl(K\otimes ^L_{A_X}K^\vee \bigr) &  \xrightarrow {\  \sim \  } &  Lg_\gamma ^*K\otimes ^L_{A_X}Lg_\gamma ^*K^\vee \\ \big\downarrow \varphi _K\otimes \varphi _{K^\vee } &  \sim &  \quad \  \sim \quad \big\downarrow \operatorname {ev}_K\\ K\otimes ^L_{A_X}K^\vee &  \xrightarrow {\  \operatorname {ev}_K\  } &  A_X \end{array}
$$

commute, by the naturality of the tensor–internal-Hom adjunction [def-weil-derived-pullback-tensor-hom] (the composite being the image of the identity under the unit–counit of the adjunction carried through the three isomorphisms), so the evaluation is a morphism of Weil objects by [lem-fix-weil-operations]. Step 3: the twisted object: $\varphi _{K^\vee (r)}=\varphi _{K^\vee }\otimes \tau _r$, the tensor of two Weil data, is a Weil datum by the compatibility of the derived tensor product with the pullback along $g_\gamma$, of [def-weil-derived-tensor] and [lem-fix-weil-operations], and $\tau _r$ is the equivariant structure of the Tate line of [def-pur-tate-datum] with normalization $q^{-r}$. Step 4: the purity identification: $\mathbb D_XK\cong K^\vee (d)[2d]$, of [prop-pod-verdier-dual-on-smooth], is an isomorphism of Weil objects by the Weil equivariance, [thm-pur-weil-equivariance-of-purity-and-trace], of the purity map and of the trace in [smooth-purity], together with the naturality of internal-Hom evaluation under the automorphism pullback in [lem-fix-weil-operations]. Step 5: the transport statements: all the constructions are those of the operations of the six-operations package, whose coefficient comparisons are built from the same evaluation and tensor maps and are preserved by the automorphism transport of [lem-fix-weil-operations]; and the data are built from the same operations, so they commute with these transports.
