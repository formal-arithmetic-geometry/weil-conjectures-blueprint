In the Poincare duality conventions of this chapter (the fixed setting), let $C$ be a bounded complex of finite-dimensional $E$-vector spaces, and let $C^\vee =R\operatorname {Hom}_E(C,E)$. The canonical evaluation $C\otimes _E^LC^\vee \to E$ induces perfect pairings

$$
H^i(C)\times H^{-i}(C^\vee )\longrightarrow E \qquad (i\in \mathbf Z),
$$

and the canonical comparison $C\to C^{\vee \vee }$ is an isomorphism; equivalently

$$
H^{-i}(C^\vee )\xrightarrow {\  \sim \  }H^i(C)^\vee \qquad (i\in \mathbf Z).
$$

## Proof

Step 1: split the complex. Since $E$ is a field, every finite-dimensional $E$-vector space is projective and injective. Let $C=(C^\bullet ,d^\bullet )$ be a bounded complex of finite-dimensional $E$-vector spaces and write $Z^j=\ker d^j$, $B^{j+1}=\operatorname {im}d^j$. Choose splittings $C^j=B^{j+1}\oplus Z^j$ of the short exact sequence $0\to Z^j\to C^j\xrightarrow {d^j}B^{j+1}\to 0$ and $Z^j=B^j\oplus H^j(C)$ of $0\to B^j\to Z^j\to H^j(C)\to 0$ (all of them split because the quotients are vector spaces). In the resulting decomposition $C^j=B^{j+1}\oplus B^j\oplus H^j(C)$, the differential sends $B^{j+1}$ onto $B^{j+1}$ (the coordinate $B^{j+1}\subset C^{j+1}$ via the chosen splitting) and kills $B^j\oplus H^j(C)$, so $C$ is the direct sum of the complexes $B^j\oplus B^j$ with the identity differential (contractible, hence zero in the derived category) and $H^j(C)$ with zero differential. Therefore

$$
C\cong \bigoplus _jH^j(C)[-j]
$$

in the derived category. Step 2: the dual. By [def-pod-perfect-point-complex] (the field stage of [def-weil-finite-coefficient-point]) $C$ is a perfect point complex, so by [def-weil-derived-pullback-tensor-hom]

$$
C^\vee =R\operatorname {Hom}_E(C,E)\cong \bigoplus _jH^j(C)^\vee [j],
$$

the direct sum of the finite-dimensional duals in the shifted degrees. Step 3: the pairings and the double dual. From Step 2,

$$
H^{-i}(C^\vee )=H^i(C)^\vee ,
$$

and the evaluation is the sum of the canonical evaluations $H^j(C)\otimes H^j(C)^\vee \to E$, which are perfect pairings of finite-dimensional vector spaces; likewise the canonical comparison $C\to C^{\vee \vee }$ is the sum of the canonical isomorphisms $H^j(C)\to H^j(C)^{\vee \vee }$, each an isomorphism because a finite-dimensional vector space is reflexive. This proves all the claims, [def-weil-finite-coefficient-point] providing the identification of the derived dual over the field with the termwise dual complex.
