*Definition (sketch).*

Let $P$ be a group and $\alpha$ an automorphism. Put
$W=P\rtimes_\alpha\mathbf Z$, with multiplication

$$
(u,n)(v,m)=(u\alpha^n(v),n+m),\qquad
\gamma=(1,1),\qquad \deg(u,n)=n.
$$

Identify $P$ with $P\times\{0\}$; every element has a unique form
$u\gamma^n$. For a field $E$, a rank-one character is a homomorphism
$\chi:W\to E^\times$. It has finite geometric image if $\chi(P)$ is
finite, and finite image if $\chi(W)$ is finite. These are distinct
conditions; no topology is needed for the following factorization.
For such a character, set $z=\chi(\gamma)$ and define the candidate functions

$$
\chi_z(w)=z^{\deg(w)},\qquad
\chi_{\mathrm{fin}}(w)=\chi(w)z^{-\deg(w)}.
$$

Their character and finiteness properties are verified below.
