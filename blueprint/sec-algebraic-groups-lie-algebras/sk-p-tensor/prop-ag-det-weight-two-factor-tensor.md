Fix a real weight character $\lambda$ as in [d-weights]. Let
$\mathcal V_0$ and $\mathcal E_0$ be nonzero lisse Weil sheaves on the
same normal geometrically connected curve $X_0$, with Weil
representations $V$ and $E$. Choose composition series in the sense of
[def-mg-weil-composition-series], with simple factors
$V_1,\ldots,V_t$ of $V$ and $E_1,\ldots,E_u$ of $E$. Assume that every
$V_i$, every $E_j$, and every Jordan–Holder constituent of
$V\otimes E$ has finite geometric determinant. Then for every
Jordan–Holder constituent $Q$ of $V\otimes E$ there is a pair $(i,j)$
with

$$
\dw_\lambda(Q)=\dw_\lambda(V_i)+\dw_\lambda(E_j).
$$

Conversely, every such sum occurs for at least one constituent. Neither
$V$, $E$ nor $V\otimes E$ is assumed semisimple.
