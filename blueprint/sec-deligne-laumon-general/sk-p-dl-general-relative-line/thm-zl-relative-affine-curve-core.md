Fix the coefficient and weight conventions of
[def-weil-punctual-weights]. Let $h:U_0\to Y_0$ be a
smooth separated morphism
between separated finite-type
$k_0$-schemes, with every nonempty geometric fiber a smooth affine
curve. Let $\mathcal F$ be a
lisse
$\Qlb$-Weil sheaf that is
punctually $\iota$-pure of weight $w$.
Then for every $i$, $R^ih_!\mathcal F$ is $\iota$-mixed of weights
at most $w+i$.

## Proof

By [lem-zl-relative-curve-punctual], all local Frobenius
eigenvalues on $R^ih_!\mathcal F$ have absolute value at most
$q_y^{(w+i)/2}$. The curve-reduction lemma [lem-zl-relative-curve-mixedness]
supplies a finite mixed filtration of this sheaf. Apply
[lem-zl-mixed-punctual-cutoff] with $v=w+i$.
This proves the bound without assuming that unrelated filtrations
of the individual stalks glue to Weil subsheaves.
