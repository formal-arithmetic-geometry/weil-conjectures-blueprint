*Lemma (sketch).*

If $f_0$ is separated and quasi-finite, then $R^if_{0!}=0$ for $i>0$,
and $f_{0!}$ preserves mixedness and upper weight bounds.

## Proof

Compact-support base change identifies the stalks with cohomology of a
finite geometric fiber, concentrated in degree zero. Thus $f_{0!}$ is
exact. At a closed point $y$, Frobenius permutes the stalk summands.
For an orbit of length $e$, an eigenvalue $\alpha$ upstairs gives
eigenvalues $\beta$ downstairs with $\beta^e=\alpha$; since
$q_x=q_y^e$, their normalized weights agree. Pure sheaves therefore
stay pure, and exactness transports a mixed filtration.
