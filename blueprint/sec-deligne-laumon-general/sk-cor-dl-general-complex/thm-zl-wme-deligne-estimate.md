For every separated finite-type morphism $f:X_0\to Y_0$ of separated
finite-type $k_0$-schemes and every constructible $\Qlb$-Weil complex
$K$ (in the coefficient categories of
[def-weil-pbc-qbar-category]),

$$
K\in D_{\le w}(X_0)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad Rf_!K\in D_{\le w}(Y_0),
$$

where $D_{\le w}$ is the complex-weight predicate of
[def-weil-complex-weights].

## Proof

By [cor-zl-rfshriek-sheaf], every mixed Weil sheaf $\mathcal F$ of
weights at most $v$ has $R^af_!\mathcal F$ mixed of weights at most
$v+a$, for every $a$. This is the hypothesis of
[lem-zl-sheaves-to-complexes], which gives $Rf_!K\in D_{\le w}(Y_0)$.
