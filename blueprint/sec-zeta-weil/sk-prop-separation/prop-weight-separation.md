Fix a prime $p$, an integer $a\in\mathbf Z_{\geq1}$, put $q=p^a$,
$k_0=\Fq$, and let $k=\Fbar$ be the
fixed algebraic closure of $k_0$.
Fix a prime $\ell\neq p$, write $\Ql=\mathbf Q_\ell$, choose an algebraic
closure $\Qlb$ of $\Ql$, and fix an isomorphism
$\iota:\Qlb\xrightarrow{\sim}\mathbf C$ and an indeterminate $T$. Let
$X_0/k_0$ be
smooth, proper, geometrically
connected of pure dimension
$d\in\mathbf Z_{\geq0}$, put $X=X_0\times_{k_0}k$, and let
$(V_{i,\ell},F_{i,\ell},P_{i,\ell})_{0\leq i\leq2d}$ be the
smooth-proper
cohomological family.
Interpret ordinary and reciprocal roots by the
root convention, and use the
absolute-value weight condition. Assume
that, for every integer $i$ with $0\leq i\leq2d$, every reciprocal root
$\alpha$ of $P_{i,\ell}$ satisfies

$$
|\iota(\alpha)|=q^{i/2}.
$$

Let $Z(X_0,T)$ be the
point-count zeta series. Assume the
trace-to-determinant identity

$$
Z(X_0,T)=\prod_{i=0}^{2d}P_{i,\ell}(T)^{(-1)^{i+1}}
\quad\text{in }\Ql(T).
$$

For all integers $0\leq i,j\leq2d$ with
$i\neq j$, the polynomials $P_{i,\ell}$ and $P_{j,\ell}$ have no common
ordinary root in $\Qlb$ and are coprime in $\Qlb[T]$. Define the
odd and even parity products by

$$
N_\ell(T)=\prod_{\substack{0\leq i\leq2d\\ i\text{ odd}}}
P_{i,\ell}(T),
\qquad
D_\ell(T)=\prod_{\substack{0\leq i\leq2d\\ i\text{ even}}}
P_{i,\ell}(T).
$$

They are coprime, have constant coefficient $1$, and the
Hasse–Weil zeta series satisfies

$$
Z(X_0,T)=\frac{N_\ell(T)}{D_\ell(T)}
$$

after coefficient extension to $\Ql[[T]]$. More precisely, the ordinary
root multiset of each $P_{i,\ell}$ is exactly the submultiset of roots of
the appropriate parity product whose reciprocal $\alpha$ satisfies

$$
|\iota(\alpha)|=q^{i/2}
$$

for the fixed isomorphism
$\iota:\Qlb\xrightarrow{\sim}\mathbf C$.

## Proof

Let $\beta\in\Qlb$ be a common ordinary root of $P_{i,\ell}$ and
$P_{j,\ell}$ with $i\ne j$. Then $\alpha=\beta^{-1}$ is a
reciprocal root of both polynomials in the sense of
[def-weil-ordinary-reciprocal-roots], so the assumed absolute
value condition gives $|\iota(\alpha)|=q^{i/2}=q^{j/2}$, hence
$i=j$, a contradiction. Thus distinct $P_{i,\ell}$ have no common
ordinary root, and since every $P_{i,\ell}$ has constant coefficient
one, they are coprime in $\Qlb[T]$; consequently the parity products
$N_\ell,D_\ell$ of [def-weil-parity-products] are coprime and
have constant coefficient one. The assumed trace-to-determinant
identity for the point-count zeta series of
[def-weil-point-counts-zeta],

$$
Z(X_0,T)=\prod_{i=0}^{2d}P_{i,\ell}(T)^{(-1)^{i+1}},
$$

groups the odd-degree factors into $N_\ell(T)$ and the even-degree
factors into $D_\ell(T)$, giving $Z(X_0,T)=N_\ell(T)/D_\ell(T)$
after coefficient extension to $\Ql[[T]]$. Every ordinary root of
$N_\ell$ is an ordinary root of exactly one $P_{j,\ell}$ with $j$
odd, and its reciprocal satisfies the assumed absolute value condition
with weight $j$; hence the submultiset of ordinary roots of $N_\ell$
whose reciprocal satisfies $|\iota(\alpha)|=q^{i/2}$ is exactly the
ordinary root multiset of $P_{i,\ell}$ for $i$ odd, and the
corresponding assertion with $D_\ell$ holds for $i$ even, which is the
asserted more precise multiset identification.
