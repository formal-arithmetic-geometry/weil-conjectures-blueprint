*Corollary (sketch).*

With the hypotheses of [sk-thm-rh] and $d\ge1$,

$$
\bigl|N_1(X_0)-(q^{d}+1)\bigr|\;\le\;\sum_{i=1}^{2d-1}b_i\,q^{i/2},
\qquad b_i=\deg P_i .
$$

For a smooth projective curve $X_0/\Fq$ of genus $g$ this reads
$|N_1-(q+1)|\le2g\sqrt q$.

## Proof

By [sk-thm-trace-transport] (a),
$N_1=\sum_{i=0}^{2d}(-1)^{i}\Tr(F_{i,\ell})$. The endpoint terms contribute
$q^{d}$ for $i=2d$ and $1$ for $i=0$ (see [sk-thm-betti]), and each of the
remaining $b_i$ eigenvalues of $F_{i,\ell}$ has absolute value $q^{i/2}$ by
[sk-thm-rh]; the triangle inequality gives the stated bound. (Both
endpoint terms must be subtracted: for $X_0=\mathbf P^1$ one has $b_1=0$
and $N_1=q+1$, so $|N_1-q^d|=1$.) For a curve
$d=1$, $b_0=b_2=1$ and $b_1=2g$, so
$|N_1-(q+1)|\le2g\sqrt q$.
