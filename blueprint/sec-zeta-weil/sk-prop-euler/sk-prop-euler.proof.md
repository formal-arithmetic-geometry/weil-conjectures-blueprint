The points of $Y_0(\Fqn)$ are the closed points of degree $r\mid n$, each
contributing $r$ points (the $\deg(y)$ embeddings of $\kappa(y)$ into
$\Fqn$); this is the geometric-Frobenius orbit decomposition and gives the
first identity. Taking $\log$ of the product and expanding each factor,
$\log\prod_y(1-T^{\deg y})^{-1}=\sum_y\sum_{m\ge1}T^{m\deg y}/m =\sum_{n\ge1}\bigl(\sum_{r\mid n}rc_r\bigr)T^{n}/n =\sum_{n\ge1}N_nT^{n}/n$, which is $\log Z$ by [sk-def-zeta]; since $\exp$
and $\log$ are inverse bijections between $T\Q[[T]]$ and $1+T\Q[[T]]$, this
gives the second identity in $1+T\Q[[T]]$. Integrality is read off from
the product, not from the exponential (which by itself only gives
$Z\in1+T\Q[[T]]$): only finitely many closed points of degree $\le m$ exist
because $Y_0$ is of finite type over a finite field, so modulo $T^{m+1}$ the
product is a finite product of the series
$(1-T^{\deg y})^{-1}=\sum_{j\ge0}T^{j\deg y}\in1+T\Z[[T]]$; hence every
coefficient of $Z$ is an integer and $Z\in1+T\Z[[T]]$.
