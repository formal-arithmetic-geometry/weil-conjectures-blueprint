Fix a finite field
$k_0=\mathbf F_q$ of characteristic $p$, with algebraic closure
$k=\overline{\mathbf F}_q$.
Let $X_0/k_0$ be
smooth, proper and geometrically
connected of pure dimension $d\geq0$, and put $X=X_0\times_{k_0}k$.
For every prime $\ell\neq p$, let $F_{i,\ell}$ be the
geometric Frobenius
on the cohomology
$H^i(X,\mathbf Q_\ell)$.
Let $Z(X_0,T)$ be the
point-count zeta series.
Then, for every integer $i$ with
$0\leq i\leq2d$, there is a
unique polynomial

$$
P_i(T)\in\mathbf Z[T]
$$

with $P_i(0)=1$ such that, for every prime $\ell\neq p$, its
coefficientwise extension $P_i^{(\ell)}(T)\in\Ql[T]$ satisfies

$$
P_i^{(\ell)}(T)=
\det(1-TF_{i,\ell}\mid H^i(X,\Ql)).
$$

Call these the
integral Frobenius factors and
retain this
coefficientwise-extension notation.
They give the rational factorization

$$
Z(X_0,T)=
\prod_{i=0}^{2d}P_i(T)^{(-1)^{i+1}},
$$

and this factorization is independent of the chosen $\ell$.

## Proof

For each $\ell$, [prop-weight-purity-roots] fixes the absolute
value of every reciprocal root of the $P_{i,\ell}$, so that the
reciprocal roots are separated by their weights, and
[prop-weight-separation] separates the odd and
even parity products. The terminal realization-independence interface
[thm-weil-realization-independence] supplies the integral factors and
their scalar identities, while [thm-weil-realization-independence] supplies
the unique intrinsic
$q$-Weil weight of every reciprocal root and the Galois-stability of the
resulting root multisets; these are therefore supplied facts rather than
additional hypotheses. Thus the hypotheses of the stratum statements
[prop-galois-weight-strata-integrality] and
[prop-galois-weight-strata-identification] are met. Applying
[prop-weil-zeta-normalized-presentation] to the fixed normalized
fraction and then these two statements to each weight stratum produces
integral polynomials. The common realization and uniqueness are exactly
[prop-integral-recovery]; its scalar-extension statement is the
displayed determinant formula, so the product identity follows.
