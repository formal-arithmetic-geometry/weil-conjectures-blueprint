For the cartesian square obtained by a weakly etale $W\to X$ and a closed
immersion $Z\to X$, restriction to $W$ commutes with the underived closed
direct image, and the two composites of inverse images agree. These
identifications respect the unit and counit of the closed adjunction.

## Proof

By the slice identification in
[lem-weil-pbc-proetale-restriction-injectives], restriction is evaluation on
objects over $W$. Both closed direct images evaluate a sheaf $G$ on such an
object $W'$ as $G(W'\times_XZ)$, so they agree with their restriction maps.
For inverse images, both composites carry a representable sheaf to the sheaf
of its base change by the same cartesian square of
[def-weil-pbc-cartesian-square-detailed]. All sheaves are colimits of
representables; for modules use free module sheaves on representables and a
cokernel presentation. Inverse images preserve these colimits, so the
identifications extend to all sheaves. In the sectionwise adjunction of the
pro-etale operations, the unit restricts a section to the base change and
the counit evaluates that restriction. The identifications just constructed
preserve these maps, which proves the claimed compatibility.
