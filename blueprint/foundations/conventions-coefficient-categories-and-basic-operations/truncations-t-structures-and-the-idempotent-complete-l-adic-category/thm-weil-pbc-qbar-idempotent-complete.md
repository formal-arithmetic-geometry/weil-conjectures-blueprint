The category $\Dbc(T,\Qlb)=\mathcal P_T$ of
[def-weil-pbc-qbar-category] is idempotent complete, and the canonical fully
faithful functor $\Dbc(T,\Qlb)\to\Kar(\Dbc(T,\Qlb))$ is an exact
equivalence.

*Source note:* no Stacks Project entry states this form: the ledger's
verified entries contain no idempotent-completion entry, and the blueprint
adds the idempotent completeness of the $\Qlb$ category together with the
equivalence of its Karoubi envelope, deduced from the filtered retract
descent and the Karoubianity of the finite-stage categories. The nearest
entries, each fetched and quoted, are the Karoubianity criteria Lemma 12.4.2
([Tag 09SH](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09SH)) and Lemma 12.4.3
([Tag 05QV](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05QV)) with Lemma 13.4.14
([Tag 05QW](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05QW), a triangulated
category with countable products, or with countable coproducts, is
Karoubian); Stacks defines no Karoubi envelope and no idempotent completion,
and the request to add the envelope stands as a comment on Homological
Algebra, Section 12.4 ([Tag
09SF](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09SF)). Difference: the
hypothesis here is not countable products or coproducts but idempotent
completeness of every finite stage, and the conclusion concerns a filtered
colimit of coefficient categories.

## Proof

By [thm-weil-pbc-finite-stage-karoubian] every finite-stage category
$\Dbc(T,E)$ is idempotent complete, so [prop-weil-filtered-retract-descent]
applies with $\mathcal P_T=\Dbc(T,\Qlb)$, as defined in
[def-weil-pbc-qbar-category]: every idempotent of $\Dbc(T,\Qlb)$ splits. The
canonical functor into the Karoubi envelope is fully faithful, and it is
essentially surjective: an object $((E,K),e)$ of the envelope is split by
the splitting of $e$ in $\mathcal P_T$ (the idempotent completeness just
proved), say by $K'\in\mathcal P_T$, $i:K'\to(E,K)$, $p:(E,K)\to K'$ with
$p\,i=\operatorname{id}$ and $i\,p=e$, and then $i$ and $p$ exhibit the
isomorphism $((E,K),e)\cong(K',\operatorname{id}_{K'})$ of the envelope (the
Karoubi-morphism conditions $p=p\circ e$ and $i=e\circ i$ follow from
$p\,i=\operatorname{id}$ and $i\,p=e$). Hence the functor is essentially
surjective, and exact because the envelope of a triangulated category is
triangulated with the canonical functor exact.
