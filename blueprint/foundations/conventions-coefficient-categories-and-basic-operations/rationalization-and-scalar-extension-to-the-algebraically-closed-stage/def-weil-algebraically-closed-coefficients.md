Fix the global finite-field datum [def-weil-finite-field-fiber]
$(p,a,q,k_0,k)$, a prime $\ell\neq p$, and a scheme $Y$. Set
$\Ql=\mathbf Q_\ell$, choose an algebraic closure $\Qlb$ of $\Ql$, and use
the rationalized category [def-weil-rationalization-karoubi] for every finite
coefficient field. Let $\mathcal E_\ell$ be the directed set of finite
extensions $E/\Ql$ contained in $\Qlb$. For $E\subset L$, the transition
functor is $K\mapsto K\otimes_E L$. Form a triangulated category $\mathcal
C_Y$ whose objects are pairs $(E,K)$ with $E\in\mathcal E_\ell$ and $K\in
D^b_c(Y,E)$, and whose morphisms between $(E,K)$ and $(E',K')$ are

$$
 \Hom_{\mathcal C_Y}((E,K),(E',K'))
 =\varinjlim_{\substack{L\in\mathcal E_\ell\\L\supset E,E'}}
 \Hom_{D^b_c(Y,L)}
 \bigl(K\otimes_E L,K'\otimes_{E'}L\bigr).
$$

Composition and distinguished triangles are represented over one common
finite extension. Define

$$
 D^b_c(Y,\Qlb)=\mathcal C_Y.
$$

No Karoubi completion is taken: the notation $\mathcal C_Y$ denotes the
common-stage category displayed above, in which no idempotent is formally
adjoined. Every object, morphism, and distinguished triangle has a finite
coefficient field of definition, after enlarging that field if necessary.
