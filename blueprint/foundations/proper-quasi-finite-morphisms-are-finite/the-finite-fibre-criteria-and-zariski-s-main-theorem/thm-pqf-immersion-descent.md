Let $f:X\to S$ be a separated morphism of finite type which is
everywhere quasi-finite, with $S$
quasi-compact and quasi-separated. Let $\nu_f:N_f\to S$ be the
relative normalization of $S$ in $X$, with $X\xrightarrow{\iota_f} N_f$ a quasi-compact open immersion, and let
$N_f=\varprojlim_\lambda T_\lambda$ be the presentation of $N_f$ as a
filtered limit of finite $S$-schemes, with affine transition maps,
supplied by the finite-approximation tail of the preceding proof. Then
there are an index $\lambda_0$ and a factorization

$$
X\xrightarrow{\ j\ }T\xrightarrow{\ i\ }T_{\lambda_0}
$$

with $j$ a quasi-compact open immersion and $i$ a closed immersion.
If moreover $S$ is
locally Noetherian — in particular if
$f$ is locally of finite presentation over a locally Noetherian
$S$ — the index $\lambda_0$ may be chosen so that
$T_{\lambda_0}$ is finite and of finite presentation over $S$.

(*Stacks Project*: the descent is the step of the proof of the
Zariski main theorem, More on Morphisms, Lemma 37.43.3,
[Tag 05K0](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05K0), that its
limit lemma
[Tag 01ZM](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01ZM) does not
supply — that lemma descends the open subscheme $\iota_f(X)$ to an
open $U\subseteq T_{\lambda_0}$, exhibiting $X$ as the fibre product
$N_f\times_{T_{\lambda_0}}U$, whose projection onto $U$ is the base
change of the integral morphism $\nu_f$, hence finite and surjective of
the same degree as $\nu_f$, and therefore not an immersion as soon as
one fibre of $\nu_f$ over $U$ has more than one point; what is
needed in addition is the spreading out of the *closed* immersion
$X\to U$, Limits of Schemes, Lemma 32.4.16,
[Tag 081B](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/081B), together with
the descent of the quasi-compact open, Limits of Schemes, Lemma 32.4.11,
[Tag 01Z4](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01Z4). The
factorization of the immersion is Morphisms of Schemes, Lemma 29.3.2,
[Tag 01QV](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01QV). The
finite-presentation refinement of the theorem,
[Tag 0F2N](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0F2N), is a
statement about the factorization scheme $T$ and not about a stage of
the presentation above: its proof replaces that presentation by an
approximating directed system of finite finitely presented $S$-schemes,
Limits of Schemes, Lemma 32.9.8,
[Tag 09YY](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/09YY). Hence for
$f$ locally of finite presentation over a general quasi-compact
quasi-separated $S$ the clause about a stage of the presentation of the
finite-approximation tail is not proved here: Tag 09YY does not apply to
that presentation, whose transition maps are affine and dual to the
injective algebra maps $\mathcal A_\lambda\hookrightarrow\mathcal A_\mu$ rather than closed immersions. The clause holds in the corrected
form proved in the last section of this
chapter: Tag 09YY, applied to the finite scheme $T$ of the factorization
constructed above, replaces it by a finite and finitely presented
$S$-scheme containing $X$ as a quasi-compact open subscheme. Over a
locally Noetherian $S$ the clause holds for the tail itself, because
every finite $S$-scheme is then of finite presentation.)

## Proof

*Step 1: the descended open.* By the finite-approximation tail of
the preceding proof, $N_f=\varprojlim_\lambda T_\lambda$ is a filtered
limit of $S$-schemes with affine transition morphisms, each
$T_\lambda$ being finite over $S$ by
[def-weil-pbc-scheme-conventions], hence quasi-compact and
quasi-separated; by the recorded input Tag 02LR, applied to the
everywhere quasi-finite morphism $f$ of [pqf-def-quasifinite],
the morphism $\iota_f$ is a quasi-compact open immersion, so
$V:=\iota_f(X)\subset N_f$ is a quasi-compact open subscheme. By
[pqf-lem-limit-qc-open-descends] there are an index $\lambda_1$
and a quasi-compact open $U_{\lambda_1}\subset T_{\lambda_1}$ with
$V=N_f\times_{T_{\lambda_1}}U_{\lambda_1}$; let $U_\lambda$ be the
preimage of $U_{\lambda_1}$ in $T_\lambda$ for
$\lambda\ge\lambda_1$. Clause (3) of the same lemma identifies $V$
with the filtered limit $\varprojlim_{\lambda\ge\lambda_1}U_\lambda$,
the projections being those of $N_f$.

*Step 2: the immersion spreads out.* The morphism $\iota_f$
induces an isomorphism $X\to V$, so $X$ is a closed subscheme of the
limit $\varprojlim_{\lambda\ge\lambda_1}U_\lambda$; the structure
morphism $X\to S$ is locally of finite type by
[def-weil-pbc-scheme-conventions] and each $U_\lambda$ is
quasi-compact. Hence [pqf-lem-limit-immersion-descends] applies and
the composite $X\to U_\lambda$ is a closed immersion for all
sufficiently large $\lambda$. Fix such an index and call it
$\lambda_0$; enlarging it if necessary we may assume
$\lambda_0\ge\lambda_1$.

*Step 3: factoring the immersion.* The composite
$h:X\to U_{\lambda_0}\hookrightarrow T_{\lambda_0}$ is an immersion,
and it is quasi-compact: for a quasi-compact open
$W\subset T_{\lambda_0}$ the intersection
$U_{\lambda_0}\cap W$ is quasi-compact by
[pqf-lem-qs-intersection-qc], since $T_{\lambda_0}$ is
quasi-separated and both $U_{\lambda_0}$ and $W$ are quasi-compact
opens, and $h^{-1}(W)=X\times_{U_{\lambda_0}}(U_{\lambda_0}\cap W)$ is
a closed subscheme of it — the base change of the closed immersion
$X\to U_{\lambda_0}$ — hence is quasi-compact. By the recorded input
Tag 01QV a quasi-compact immersion factors as an open immersion followed
by a closed immersion: there are a scheme $T$, an open immersion
$j:X\to T$ and a closed immersion $i:T\to T_{\lambda_0}$ with
$h=i\circ j$. In that construction $T$ is the closed subscheme of
$T_{\lambda_0}$ whose sheaf of ideals is the kernel of
$\mathcal O_{T_{\lambda_0}}\to h_*\mathcal O_X$, so that $X$ is the
fibre product $T\times_{T_{\lambda_0}}U_{\lambda_0}$ and $j$ is the
base change of the open immersion
$U_{\lambda_0}\hookrightarrow T_{\lambda_0}$ along the closed immersion
$i$; that open immersion is quasi-compact for the same reason as
$h$, and quasi-compactness is stable under base change, so $j$ is a
quasi-compact open immersion, as required.

*Step 4: the finitely presented stage.* If $S$ is
[pqf-def-locnoeth], then the finite morphism
$T_{\lambda_0}\to S$ is of finite presentation by
[pqf-lem-finite-fp-locnoeth], so the index $\lambda_0$ fixed in
Step 2 satisfies the additional clause of the statement.
