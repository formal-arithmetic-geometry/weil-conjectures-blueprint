Let $\Phi:\mathcal C\to\mathcal D$ be a homological functor
[def-sp-homological-functor] with $\mathcal D$ abelian
[def-sp-abelian]. For every distinguished triangle $K_1\to K_2\to K_3\to
K_1[1]$ there is a long exact sequence

$$
 \cdots\to\Phi(K_1)\to\Phi(K_2)\to\Phi(K_3)
 \xrightarrow{\ \delta\ }\Phi(K_1[1])\to\cdots
$$

whose connecting map $\delta$ is natural in the triangle.

## Proof

This is the definition of [def-sp-homological-functor] applied to $F=\Phi$:
the exactness at the middle spots of the two halves of the triangle (the
rotation of a distinguished triangle is distinguished) iterates to the
infinite long exact sequence, and the connecting map is obtained by applying
$\Phi$ to the rotation morphism $K_3\to K_1[1]$ of the triangle.
