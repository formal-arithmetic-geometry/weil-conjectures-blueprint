For a morphism [def-weil-pbc-scheme-conventions] $u:U\to V$ of schemes, the
inverse image [def-weil-pbc-inverse-image]

$$
 u^{-1}:\Ab(V_{\Et})\longrightarrow\Ab(U_{\Et})
$$

of [def-weil-pbc-inverse-image] is an exact functor.

## Proof

By [def-weil-pbc-inverse-image] the functor $u^{-1}$ is the left adjoint of
the direct image $u_*$ of [def-weil-pbc-direct-image] and is obtained by
sheafifying the presheaf inverse image along the functor $U_{\Et}\to V_{\Et}$
of [def-weil-pbc-etale-site]. The presheaf inverse image is computed
sectionwise by a filtered colimit of sections of the given presheaf; it has a
left adjoint (extension by zero of presheaves) and a right adjoint (presheaf
direct image), so it preserves kernels and cokernels and is exact.
Sheafification of presheaves of abelian groups is exact (Stacks Project,
Lemma 7.10.15, Tag [00WJ](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00WJ)), and a
composite of exact functors is exact, so $u^{-1}$ is exact. This is the
exactness of pullback of abelian sheaves on small etale sites (Stacks
Project, Lemma 59.36.2, Tag
[03Q1](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03Q1)); the source category is
the category of sheaves of [def-weil-pbc-etale-sheaves].
