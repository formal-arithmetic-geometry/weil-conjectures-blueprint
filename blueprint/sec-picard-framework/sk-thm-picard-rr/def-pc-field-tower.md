Let $K/k$ be a field extension. It is *finite* if $[K:k]<\infty$,
*algebraic* if every element of $K$ is algebraic over $k$,
*finite separable* if it is finite and every element has a separable
minimal polynomial over $k$, and *purely inseparable* if every
element $\alpha\in K$ satisfies $\alpha^{p^n}\in k$ for some $n$ (in
characteristic $0$ this means $K=k$). An *algebraic closure*
$\bar k$ of $k$ is an algebraically closed extension of $k$ which is
algebraic over $k$.
