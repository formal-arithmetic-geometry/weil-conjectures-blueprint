*Lemma (sketch).*

Let $X$ be separated over an affine base and let $\mathfrak U$ be an
open affine covering. Then for every quasi-coherent $\cO_X$-module
$\cF$ the edge map of [sk-thm-picard-cech] is an isomorphism

$$
\Cech^q(\mathfrak U,\cF)\overset{\sim}{\longrightarrow}H^q(X,\cF)
\qquad(q\ge0).
$$

## Proof

*Step 1 (the intersections are affine).* For two affine opens
$U,V\subseteq X$ the intersection $U\cap V$ is the preimage of $U\times V$
under the diagonal of $X$; separatedness makes the diagonal a closed
immersion, and $U\times V$ is affine over the affine base, so $U\cap V$
is a closed subscheme of an affine scheme, hence affine. Iterating,
every $U_{i_0\dots i_p}=U_{i_0}\cap\dots\cap U_{i_p}$ is affine.

*Step 2 (the spectral sequence collapses).* Feed $\mathfrak U$ to
[sk-thm-picard-cech]. For $q>0$ the presheaf $\mathcal H^q(\cF)$
vanishes on each $U_{i_0\dots i_p}$ by Step 1 and
[sk-lem-picard-affine], so $E_2^{p,q}=\Cech^p(\mathfrak U,\mathcal H^q(\cF))=0$ for $q>0$. Only the row $q=0$ survives, the
sequence degenerates, and the edge maps
$\Cech^q(\mathfrak U,\cF)\to H^q(X,\cF)$ are isomorphisms in every
degree; this is the collapse described in Step 4 of the proof of
[sk-thm-picard-cech].
