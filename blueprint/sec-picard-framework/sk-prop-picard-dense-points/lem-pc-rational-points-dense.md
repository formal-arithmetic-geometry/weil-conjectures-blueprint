Let $k$ be a separably closed field,
let $X$ be a scheme over $k$ which is smooth over $k$. Then $X(k)$ is
dense in $X$; if $X$ is nonempty, then $X(k)\neq\emptyset$.

## Proof

By [lem-pc-dense-separable-points] the set of closed points $x$ with
$\kappa(x)/k$ finite separable is dense in $X$. For such an $x$,
$\kappa(x)=k$ by [lem-pc-sepclosed-finite-sep-trivial], so $x$ is a
$k$-rational point and the assertion follows.
