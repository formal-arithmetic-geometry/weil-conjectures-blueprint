Let $A$ be Noetherian, $P=\hyperref[def:pc-projective-space-twist]{\mathbf P^n_A}$,
and $\mathcal F$ a coherent module.
Then each $H^q(P,\mathcal F)$ is a finite $A$-module.

## Proof

We descend on $q$, proving the assertion for all coherent modules
at once. For $q>n$ it follows from
[lem-pc-projective-space-cohomology-bound].
Suppose it is known in degree $q+1$ for every coherent module.
For a given $\mathcal F$, choose the exact sequence
$0\to\mathcal K\to\mathcal E\to\mathcal F\to0$ of
[lem-pc-projective-space-twist-quotient], with $\mathcal E$
a finite sum of twists and $\mathcal K$ coherent.
The long exact sequence of [pqf-def-cohomology] contains

$$
H^q(P,\mathcal E)\longrightarrow H^q(P,\mathcal F)
\longrightarrow H^{q+1}(P,\mathcal K).
$$

The first term is finite by
[lem-pc-projective-space-twist-cohomology]; the last is finite
by the induction hypothesis applied to $\mathcal K$.
The middle term is an extension of a quotient of the first term
by a submodule of the last. Quotients and extensions of finite
modules are finite; the submodule is finite because $A$ is
Noetherian. This proves the induction step, including $q=0$.
