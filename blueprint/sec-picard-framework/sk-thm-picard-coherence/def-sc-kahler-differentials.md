Let $C$ be a smooth curve over $k$.
The *sheaf of Kähler differentials* of $C$ over $k$ is

$$
\Omega^1_{C/k}:=\Delta^*\bigl(\mathcal I/\mathcal I^2\bigr),
$$

where $\Delta:C\to C\times_kC$ is the diagonal immersion and
$\mathcal I\subseteq\mathcal O_{C\times_kC}$ the ideal sheaf of the
diagonal; equivalently, on an affine open
$U=\operatorname{Spec}A\subseteq C$, $\Omega^1_{C/k}|_U$ is the
sheaf associated with the $A$-module $\Omega^1_{A/k}$ of Kähler
differentials of the $k$-algebra $A$ with its universal
derivation $d:A\to\Omega^1_{A/k}$, the standard affine description.
The *canonical sheaf* of $C$ is

$$
\omega_C:=\Omega^1_{C/k}.
$$
