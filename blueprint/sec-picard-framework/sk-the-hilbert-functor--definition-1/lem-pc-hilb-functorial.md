Let $X\to S$ be a morphism of schemes and $d\ge0$. The assignment
$T\mapsto\operatorname{Hilb}^d_{X/S}(T)$ of
Definition [def-pc-hilb-functor] is
a functor $(\mathit{Sch}/S)^{\mathrm{op}}\to\textit{Sets}$: for
$g:T'\to T$ and $Z\in\operatorname{Hilb}^d_{X/S}(T)$, the base change
$Z_{T'}:=Z\times_TT'$ is a closed subscheme of $X_{T'}$ finite locally
free of degree $d$ over $T'$.

## Proof

The fibre square $X_{T'}=X_T\times_TT'$ shows $Z_{T'}\subset X_{T'}$ is
a closed subscheme (base change of the closed immersion
$Z\subset X_T$: closed immersions are stable under base change,
[lem-pc-closed-imm-base-change] —included below). Its structure
morphism $Z_{T'}\to T'$ is the base change of $Z\to T$, hence finite,
flat and locally of finite presentation (finite: base change of finite;
flat: base change of flat; fpp: base change of f.p.); and the degree is
$d$ (by base change: for $t'\in T'$ over $t\in T$ the fibre
$Z_{T',t'}=Z_t\otimes_{\kappa(t)}\kappa(t')$, and
$\Gamma(Z_{t'},\mathcal{O})=\Gamma(Z_t,\mathcal{O})\otimes\kappa(t')$
([lem-pc-flf-properties] and
[lem-pc-flat-base-change-cohom]), of dimension $d$.
