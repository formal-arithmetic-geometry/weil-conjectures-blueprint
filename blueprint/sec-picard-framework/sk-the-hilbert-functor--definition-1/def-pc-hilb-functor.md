Let $X\to S$ be a morphism of schemes and $d\geq0$. For a scheme $T$
over $S$ put

$$
\operatorname{Hilb}^d_{X/S}(T):=\bigl\{Z\subset X_T\ \text{a closed subscheme}:\
Z\to T\text{ is finite, flat and locally of finite presentation of degree }d\bigr\},
$$

where "of degree $d$" means that the rank of $Z\to T$ is constantly equal to $d$, i.e. $Z\to T$
is finite locally free of degree $d$ in the sense of
Definition [def-pc-finite-locally-free], and $X_T$ is the base change of
[def-pc-base-change]. If this functor is representable
([def-pc-representable-functor]), the representing scheme is
$\underline{\operatorname{Hilb}}^d_{X/S}$.
