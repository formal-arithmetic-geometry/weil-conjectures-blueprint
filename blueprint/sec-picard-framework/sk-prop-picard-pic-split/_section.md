*Proposition (sketch).*

Let $f:X\to S$ with a section $\sigma$ and
$\cO_T\overset{\sim}{\to}f_{T,*}\cO_{X_T}$ for all
$T\in\Ob((\Sch/S)_{fppf})$ (for $X\to\Spec k$ a smooth projective
curve with a $k$-point: $H^0(X,\cO_X)=k$ and the flat base change
gives the condition). Then the sequence

$$
0\longrightarrow\Pic(T)\xrightarrow{\ f_T^*\ }\Pic(X_T)
\longrightarrow\Pic_{X/S}(T)\longrightarrow 0
$$

is exact and split by $\sigma_T^*$;
$\Pic(X_T)=\Pic(T)\oplus\Pic_{X/S,\sigma}(T)$, and
$\Pic_{X/S}$ is the sheafification of
$T\mapsto\Pic_{X/S,\sigma}(T)$.

## Proof

Injectivity and the descent of fppf-local trivializations prove
exactness; $\sigma_T^*\circ f_T^*=\mathrm{id}$ and the decomposition
$\cL=f_T^*\sigma_T^*\cL\otimes(\cL\otimes f_T^*\sigma_T^*\cL^{-1})$
give the splitting; the sheaf property of
$K(T)=\ker\sigma_T^*$ is [sk-cor-picard-pic-sheaf].
