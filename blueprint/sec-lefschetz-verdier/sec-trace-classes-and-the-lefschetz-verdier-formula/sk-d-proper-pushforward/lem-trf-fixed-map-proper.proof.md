Put $G=C\times_DF_b$, with projections $\pi:G\to F_b$ and
$j:G\to C$. By [def-trf-fixed-scheme],
$F_b=D\times_{Y\times_sY,\Delta_Y}Y$, so a $T$-point of $G$ is a pair
$(t,y)$ of $t\in C(T)$ and $y\in Y(T)$ with $b(g(t))=(y,y)$, i.e. with
$fc_1(t)=y=fc_2(t)$. Hence $(c_1,c_2)\circ j$ factors through
$X\times_YX\subset X\times_sX$, giving a morphism $\lambda:G\to X\times_YX$.
The morphism $X\times_YX\to X\times_sX$ is a monomorphism (it is the base
change of the monomorphism $\Delta_Y$). Therefore a $T$-point of
$G\times_{X\times_YX,\lambda,\Delta_{X/Y}}X$ is a pair $((t,y),x)$ with
$(c_1t,c_2t)=(x,x)$, and then $y=fx$ is determined; that is, exactly a
pair $(t,x)$ with $c(t)=\Delta_X(x)$, which is a $T$-point of
$F_c=C\times_{X\times_sX,c,\Delta_X}X$. These identifications are natural
in $T$, so

$$
F_c\cong G\times_{X\times_YX,\Delta_{X/Y}}X,
$$

and the first projection $\kappa:F_c\to G$, $\kappa=(i_c,f d_c)$, is the
base change of $\Delta_{X/Y}$. Since $\pi\kappa=(g i_c,fd_c)$ as a map to
$D\times_{Y\times_sY}Y$, the identities $i_bh=gi_c$, $d_bh=fd_c$ of
[def-trf-coefficient-pushforward] give $\pi\kappa=h$. This is (1),
except for the closed immersion claim.

The proper $f$ is separated, so $\Delta_{X/Y}$ is a closed immersion
([def-weil-scheme-morphism-properties]), and so is its base change
$\kappa$. Closed immersions are proper
([lem-weil-pbc-closed-immersion-proper]); $\pi$ is proper as a base change
of the proper $g$, and $h=\pi\kappa$ is proper as a composite
([lem-kun-proper-stability]). Finally
$q=(f\times\operatorname{id}_Y)\circ(\operatorname{id}_X\times f)$ is a
composite of base changes of $f$, hence proper by
[lem-kun-proper-stability]. This proves (2). The last assertion is the
definition of [def-trf-borel-moore-pushforward] applied to the proper $h$,
$T=F_c$, $T'=F_b$ and $\alpha=\operatorname{Tr}_c(u)$.
