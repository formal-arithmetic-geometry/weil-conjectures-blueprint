Let $f:X\to S$ be a morphism of schemes and let $g:S'\to S$ be a morphism,
with base change $f':X_{S'}\to S'$ of $f$ along $g$. Then the restriction of
the Picard functor $\operatorname{Pic}_{X/S}$ to the slice site
$(\mathit{Sch}/S')_{fppf}\subseteq(\mathit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$ is the Picard
functor $\operatorname{Pic}_{X_{S'}/S'}$.

## Proof

For $T\in\mathit{Ob}((\mathit{Sch}/S')_{fppf})$ the base changes agree:
$X_T=(X_{S'})_T$ as schemes over $T$, by transitivity of the fibre product.
Hence the Picard *presheaves* $T\mapsto\operatorname{Pic}(X_T)$ and
$T\mapsto\operatorname{Pic}((X_{S'})_T)$ are literally the same functor on
the slice.

Sheafification of a presheaf on a site is computed by applying the plus
construction to the restriction of the presheaf to the slice categories of
the coverings, and the coverings of $(\mathit{Sch}/S')_{fppf}$ are exactly
the fppf coverings in $(\mathit{Sch}/S)_{fppf}$ whose objects lie over $S'$;
since the two presheaves coincide on the whole slice, so do their
sheafifications, and the resulting restriction is the Picard functor
$\operatorname{Pic}_{X_{S'}/S'}$.

This is the assertion, and it is the remark following Stacks Project,
