Let $I$ be a directed set, let $(S_i,f_{ii'})$ be an inverse system of
schemes over $I$ with affine transition morphisms and $S_i$ quasi-compact and
quasi-separated, and put $S=\varprojlim_iS_i$. Then:

1. for every morphism of finite presentation $V\to S$ there are $i\in I$ and
   a morphism of finite presentation $V_i\to S_i$ with
   $V\cong V_i\times_{S_i}S$;
2. given $i$, schemes $V_i,W_i$ of finite presentation over $S_i$ and a
   morphism $\psi:V_i\times_{S_i}S\to W_i\times_{S_i}S$, there are
   $i'\geq i$ and a morphism
   $\psi_{i'}:V_i\times_{S_i}S_{i'}\to W_i\times_{S_i}S_{i'}$ whose base
   change to $S$ is $\psi$;
3. given $i$, schemes $V_i,W_i$ of finite presentation over $S_i$ and two
   morphisms $\psi_i,\chi_i:V_i\to W_i$ whose base changes to $S$ agree,
   there is $i'\geq i$ with
   $\psi_i\times_{S_i}S_{i'}=\chi_i\times_{S_i}S_{i'}$.

## Proof

This is Stacks Project, Limits of Schemes, Lemma 32.10.1, [Tag
01ZM](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01ZM); the proof is the standard
reduction to the affine case, where it is Algebra, Lemma 10.127.8, [Tag
05N9](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05N9): a finitely presented
algebra is the colimit of its finitely generated subalgebras, and two maps
out of a finitely presented algebra agree after passing to a sufficiently
large stage. The passage from the affine case to the general case is carried
out in loc. cit. by choosing finite affine open coverings and glueing; the
three assertions are proved there in the order (3), (2), (1), and we use them
in that order.

The only two notions the statement needs are "of finite presentation" and the
fibre product $V_i\times_{S_i}S$, which are the ones appearing in its three
clauses. We record the statement here because the chapter needs exactly those
clauses, and because the generality of the cover $\Spec(k_s)\to\Spec(k)$ is
what forces this detour through a filtered limit.
