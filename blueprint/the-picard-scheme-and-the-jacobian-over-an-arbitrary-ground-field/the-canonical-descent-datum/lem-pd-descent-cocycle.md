In the situation of [lem-pd-canonical-descent-datum], the isomorphism
$\varphi$ satisfies the cocycle condition of [def-pd-descent-datum].

## Proof

Write $X_3=X\times_YX\times_YX=\Spec(k_s\otimes_kk_s\otimes_kk_s)$ for the
triple fibre product and let
$\mathrm{pr}_{01},\mathrm{pr}_{02},\mathrm{pr}_{12}:X_3\to X_2$ be the
projections, so that $\varphi$ is the isomorphism of
[lem-pd-canonical-descent-datum].

By [cor-pd-pic0-base-change] all six pullbacks of $J_s$ to $X_3$ represent
one and the same functor, namely the restriction of
$\operatorname{Pic}^0_{C/k}$ to the slice over $X_3$. Both composites
$\mathrm{pr}_{02}^*\varphi$ and
$\mathrm{pr}_{12}^*\varphi\circ\mathrm{pr}_{01}^*\varphi$ are isomorphisms
between two representing objects of that functor which respect the
representing identifications, so they agree by the uniqueness statement for
Jacobians (applied over $X_3$). This is the cocycle condition of
[def-pd-descent-datum].
