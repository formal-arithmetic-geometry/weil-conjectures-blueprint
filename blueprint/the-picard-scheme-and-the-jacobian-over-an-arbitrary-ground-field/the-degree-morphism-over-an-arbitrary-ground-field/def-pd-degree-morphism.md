Let $k$ be a field. The *constant sheaf* $\underline{\Z}$ on the fppf site
$(\mathit{Sch}/k)_{fppf}$ is the sheaf associated with the constant presheaf
$T\mapsto\Z$; its value on $T$ is the group of locally constant functions
$T\to\Z$.

Let now $C$ be a smooth projective curve over $k$ which is geometrically
integral and let $\operatorname{Pic}_{C/k}$ be the Picard functor. The
*degree morphism*
$$
\deg:\operatorname{Pic}_{C/k}\longrightarrow\underline{\Z}
$$
is the morphism of fppf sheaves defined as follows: for $T$ over $k$ and a
class in $\operatorname{Pic}_{C/k}(T)$ choose an fppf covering
$\{T_i\to T\}$ and invertible $\mathcal{O}_{C_{T_i}}$-modules
$\mathcal{L}_i$ representing the pullbacks of the class along the Picard
presheaf; the locally constant functions
$t\mapsto\deg_{T_i}(\mathcal{L}_i)(t)$ of [def-pd-fibrewise-degree] agree on
the overlaps by [lem-pd-degree-locally-constant](2–3) and glue to a locally
constant function $T\to\Z$, giving an element of $\underline{\Z}(T)$; the
result is independent of all choices by [lem-pd-degree-locally-constant].

The *degree-zero part* of the Picard functor is the subfunctor
$$
\operatorname{Pic}^0_{C/k}:=\ker(\deg)\subseteq\operatorname{Pic}_{C/k}
$$
in the subfunctor sense: its value on $T$ consists of the classes whose
fibrewise degree function is identically zero.
