Let $f:X\to S$ be smooth, separated, compactifiable
[def-asd-compactifiable], and of pure relative dimension $d$, with
Noetherian base. Put $\omega_f=f^\times A_S$, using the ambient right
adjoint. Then $\omega_f[-2d]$ is a locally constant sheaf of free rank-one
$A$-modules. For every complex $K$ on $S$, the canonical tensor morphism is
an isomorphism
$$
f^*K\otimes_A^L\omega_f\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }f^\times K.
$$

## Proof

Construct the tensor morphism by transposing
$$
Rf_!(f^*K\otimes_A^L\omega_f)\cong K\otimes_A^LRf_!\omega_f\longrightarrow K\otimes_A^LA_S=K
$$
under [thm-amb-etale-exceptional-adjoint]. The displayed projection formula
follows from [lem-amb-proper-coproducts-projection] on a compactification:
extension by zero commutes with tensoring a pulled-back complex, as its
stalk is either that complex or zero.

By the étale-local normal form of a smooth morphism, every point of $X$ has
an étale neighbourhood $u:U\to X$ such that $fu=p_de$, where
$e:U\to\mathbf A^d_S$ is étale (one may restrict the base to an open
neighbourhood). The adjunctions in [lem-amb-etale-adjoint-locality] and
[cor-amb-affine-space-adjunction] identify
$$
u^*f^\times K\cong e^*p_d^*K(d)[2d],\qquad u^*\omega_f\cong A_U(d)[2d].
$$

By its definition as the transpose of the projection formula and counit, the
tensor map restricts under these identifications to the canonical
reassociation $(fu)^*K\otimes_A^LA_U(d)[2d]\cong(fu)^*K(d)[2d]$. To check
this assertion, transpose on $U$: both maps become the projection formula
followed by the composite of the étale counit with the $d$ affine-line
counits. The uniqueness in the adjunction bijection therefore identifies
them. In particular it is an isomorphism locally on $X$, hence globally by
conservativity of geometric stalks.

The same local calculation shows that all cohomology sheaves of $\omega_f$
except $\mathcal H^{-2d}$ vanish, and that $\mathcal H^{-2d}(\omega_f)$ is
étale-locally free of rank one. The canonical truncation isomorphism
$\omega_f\cong\mathcal H^{-2d}(\omega_f)[2d]$ gives the stated conclusion.

No complexes or morphisms were glued in a derived category: the adjoint and
tensor morphism were constructed globally, and geometric stalks only tested
their properties.
