In the square [sbc-def-base-change-square] of [sbc-thm-smooth-base-change],
assume $f$ smooth, $g$ quasi-compact and quasi-separated, all schemes
Noetherian, $\ell$ invertible, and let $K_E\in\Dbc(T,E)$ admit a
finite-level étale admissible lattice. Then the exchange morphism is an
isomorphism in the ambient rationalized complete category
$$
Lf^*_{\mathrm{comp},E}Rg_{*,\mathrm{comp},E}K_E
\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }Rh_{*,\mathrm{comp},E}Le^*_{\mathrm{comp},E}K_E
\quad\text{in }D_{\mathrm{comp}}(S,E),
$$
independent of the lattice, and an isomorphism in $\Dbc(S,E)$ if the lattice
is square-constructibly admissible.

## Proof

The two-term free resolution
$[\mathcal O_E\xrightarrow{\varpi^{n+1}}\mathcal O_E]$ of $A_n$ and the adic
theorem [sbc-thm-adic-smooth-base-change] give the statement for integral
lattices; central localization (inverting multiplication by $\varpi$) of the
rationalized category gives it for $K_E$, independent of the admissible
lattice, and the constructible landing is the four-system hypothesis of
[sbc-def-admissible-lattices].
