For every $g\in\operatorname{GL}_d(\mathcal O_S(S))$,
the linear automorphism of $\mathbf A^d_S$ induced
by $g$ preserves the affine-space trace
$t_{p_d}:Rp_{d!}A(d)[2d]\to A_S$.
The notation refers to Tate twists, and ordinary derived categories.

## Proof

Let $G=\operatorname{GL}_{d,S}$, the open subscheme
$\det\ne0$ of the affine scheme of $d$-by-$d$
matrices. Over $G$, the universal invertible matrix
defines an automorphism $a$ of $\mathbf A^d_G$.
Functoriality of compact supports from
[def-amb-etale-compact-support] gives an
automorphism of $Rp_{d!}A(d)[2d]$ over $G$.
By [lem-amb-affine-space-top-trace], this is an
automorphism of the sheaf $A_G$ in degree zero.
It is therefore multiplication by a locally constant
section $b$ of the finite constant sheaf $A$.
This uses ordinary sheaf endomorphisms, not cohomology
with support on a zero section.

Every geometric fibre of $G\to S$ is connected:
its coordinate ring is a polynomial ring over an
algebraically closed field with the determinant
inverted, hence an integral domain. The locally
constant section $b$ is constant on such a fibre.
At its identity matrix $a$ is the identity
automorphism, so $b=1$ there and therefore on the
whole fibre. Every geometric point of $G$ belongs
to one of these fibres; conservativity of stalks in
[lem-weil-pbc-geometric-stalk-conservative] gives
$b=1$ globally. Finally the given matrix $g$
is a section $S\to G$. Pulling back this equality
and using the base-change compatibility in
[lem-amb-affine-space-top-trace] proves the assertion.
