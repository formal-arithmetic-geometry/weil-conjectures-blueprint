Let $K\in D^+_{\mathcal P\text{-tor}}(T_{\Et})$. For fixed $n$, only
$H^q(K)$ with $q\leq n$ can contribute to $H^n(Rg_*K)$. Hence
$$
H^n(Rg_*\tau_{\leq n}K)\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }H^n(Rg_*K),
$$
and the analogous statement holds after pullback and for $h_*$.

## Proof

The hypercohomology spectral sequence [def-weil-pbc-hypercohomology-filtrations] has
$E_2^{p,q}=R^pg_*H^q(K)$; for
$p+q=n$ only $q\leq n$ contributes since $g_*$ is $t$-left exact, so
$H^n(Rg_*\tau_{\leq n}K)\cong H^n(Rg_*K)$; pullback and $h$ are handled
identically.
