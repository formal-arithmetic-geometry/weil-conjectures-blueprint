Let $X$ be integral of finite type over a field, let
$k:V\hookrightarrow X$ be a nonempty normal
[def-sbc-normal-dominant-galois] open, and let $L$ be a finite locally
constant module sheaf over a finite ring. Then the direct image $k_*L$ is
constructible.

## Proof

Choose a finite étale surjective $p:P\to V$ trivializing $L$, by
[fin2-lem-lisse-trivialized-finite-etale]. Write $P=\coprod P_a$ for its
finitely many connected components and write the corresponding constant
module as $M_a$. The adjunction unit $L\to p_*p^*L$ is injective: the finite
stalk formula identifies it with a diagonal into a nonempty finite product
of copies of the original stalk. Direct image is left exact, so
$$
k_*L\hookrightarrow\prod_a(kp_a)_*\underline{M_a}.
$$

Extend $P_a$ to the normalization $g_a:Y_a\to X$ using
[lem-fin-normalization-extends-cover], and let
$v_a:P_a\hookrightarrow Y_a$ be the resulting nonempty open. The source
$Y_a$ is normal integral. By [lem-fin-normal-constant-open-image],
$v_{a,*}\underline{M_a}=\underline{M_a}_{Y_a}$. Direct-image composition
therefore gives $(kp_a)_*\underline{M_a}=g_{a,*}\underline{M_a}$.

Each of these sheaves is constructible by
[lem-fin-finite-constant-pushforward]; so is their finite product, by a
common finite lisse partition. Constructible sheaves on a Noetherian scheme
are closed under subobjects, which proves constructibility of $k_*L$.
