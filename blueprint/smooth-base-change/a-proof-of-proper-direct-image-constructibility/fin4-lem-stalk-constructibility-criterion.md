Let $X$ be a Noetherian scheme and let $F$ be an abelian étale sheaf on $X$
with finite geometric stalks. For $n\geq1$ put
$C_n=\{x\in X:|F_{\bar x}|=n\}$. Then $F$ is constructible if and only if
every $C_n$ is a constructible subset of $X$. For an abelian sheaf,
constructibility here means a finite locally closed partition with finite
locally constant restrictions.

## Proof

If $F$ is constructible, refine its finite partition and its finite étale
trivializations so that stalk cardinality is constant on each part. Each
$C_n$ is a finite union of these parts.

Conversely use Noetherian induction on closed subsets of $X$. Pullback to a
closed subset preserves stalks; the new level sets are intersections with
$C_n$, hence are constructible. It suffices to find a nonempty open where
$F$ is finite locally constant. Choose an irreducible component with generic
point $\eta$. Remove the other finitely many components to obtain a nonempty
irreducible open $X_0$. Put $M=F_{\bar\eta}$ and $m=|M|$. The constructible
subset $C_m\cap X_0$ contains $\eta$, hence contains a nonempty open $U$ of
$X_0$: among its finitely many locally closed pieces one contains $\eta$,
and that piece's closed factor must be all of $X_0$.

A finite abelian group has finitely many generators and relations. Lift its
generators to sections on one pointed affine étale neighbourhood $V\to U$ of
$\bar\eta$. The relations have zero germs; finitely many further refinements
make all of them zero as sections. Thus we obtain
$\varphi:\underline M_V\to F|_V$ inducing the identity on $M$. The chosen
point over $\eta$ is generic in a component of $V$: an étale morphism is
flat with zero-dimensional fibres, so a point over a generic point is itself
generic. Remove the other components to make $V$ irreducible, retaining this
point.

For $a\ne0$ in $M$, the zero-germ locus of $\varphi(a)$ is open in $V$. A
zero germ is represented by the zero section on an étale neighbourhood; the
images of these neighbourhoods are open, and their union is that locus. It
omits the generic point because $\varphi_{\bar\eta}$ is injective. An open
subset of irreducible $V$ omitting its generic point is empty. Consequently
$\varphi$ is injective at every geometric stalk. Both sides have $m$
elements at each stalk, so it is an isomorphism by conservativity.

The image $W$ of $V\to X$ is nonempty and open, and the étale cover $V\to W$
trivializes $F|_W$. Induction supplies a finite partition on $X\setminus W$;
adjoining $W$ proves constructibility. This also proves finiteness of the
image of $x\mapsto|F_{\bar x}|$; it was not inferred from an infinite union
of constructible subsets.

The classical statement is [SGA 4, Exposé IX, Proposition
2.13(iii)](https://grothendiecksga.com/read/sga4/en/IX-2.html).
