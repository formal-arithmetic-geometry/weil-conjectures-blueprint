Let $G$ be profinite and $\ell$ prime. Suppose that
$H^2(H,\mathbf F_\ell)=0$ for every open subgroup $H\subset G$, with trivial
coefficients. Then $H^q(G,M)=0$ for $q\geq2$ and every discrete continuous
$\ell$-primary module $M$, with cohomology as in
[def-exc-continuous-cohomology].

## Proof

For finite $M$, apply [lem-sc-sylow-module-filtration]. The long exact
cohomology sequence, one filtration step at a time, gives $H^2(H,M)=0$.
Restriction followed by corestriction on $H^2(G,M)$ is multiplication by
$[G:H]$. This follows from the coset-sum formula for corestriction on the
continuous cochains of [def-exc-continuous-cohomology]; conjugation by an
element of $G$ induces the identity on its cohomology. As the index is prime
to $\ell$, multiplication by it is invertible on an $\ell$-primary group.
Hence $H^2(G,M)=0$.

An arbitrary discrete $\ell$-primary module is the directed union of its
finite $G$-stable submodules. Indeed the orbit of each element is finite,
and a finite set of finite-order generators generates a finite abelian
group. A continuous cochain on the compact space $G^q$ has finite image, so
it is contained in one such submodule. Thus continuous cochain complexes,
and their cohomology, commute with this union. This proves $H^2(G,M)=0$
without a finiteness assumption.

Finally embed $M$ equivariantly in the coinduced module
$\operatorname{Cont}(G,M)$ by $m\mapsto(g\mapsto gm)$, with right
translation on the functions. This is a discrete $\ell$-primary module. The
continuous cochain complex of a coinduced module is contractible in positive
degrees: in homogeneous cochains the contraction inserts the function
argument as the first group argument. Its cokernel is again discrete
$\ell$-primary. The long exact sequence therefore identifies
$H^{q+1}(G,M)$ with $H^q(G,\operatorname{coker})$ for $q\geq1$. Repeated
dimension shifting reduces every degree at least two to the vanishing of
$H^2$ just proved.
