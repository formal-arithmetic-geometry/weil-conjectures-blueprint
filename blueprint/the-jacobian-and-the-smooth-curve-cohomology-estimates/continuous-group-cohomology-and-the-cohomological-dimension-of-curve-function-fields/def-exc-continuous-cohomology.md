For a profinite group $G$ and a finite ring $A$, a *discrete $A$-module with
continuous $G$-action* is an $A$-module $M$ with a $G$-action by $A$-linear
automorphisms such that every element has an open stabilizer. This is an
abelian category. Its invariant functor sends $M$ to
$M^G=\{m:gm=m\text{ for all }g\in G\}$.

The *continuous cohomology* $H^q(G,M)$ is its right derived functor, formed
in the ordinary derived category. Equivalently it is computed by the complex
of continuous inhomogeneous cochains $G^q\to M$, with the usual group-cochain
differential.
