Take $\Lambda=\overline{\mathbf Q}_\ell$.

Choose finite affine covers of $X$ and $Y$ and closed immersions
$U\hookrightarrow\mathbf A^d_V$. Here $u:U\to X$ and $v:V\to Y$ are the
inclusions of the affine opens, and $i:U\hookrightarrow\mathbf A^d_V$ and
$p:\mathbf A^d_V\to V$ are the two factors. Then $u^*f^!\simeq i^!p^!v^*$
(Proposition [proposition-composition-open-restriction-compactifications-f]), and being in $\Dbc$ is local
on $X$, so it suffices to show that $p^!$ and $i^!$ preserve $\Dbc$.

For $E$ and $\overline{\mathbf Q}_\ell$ we argue as in Section [sec-Finite-coefficients-2]. We use
Proposition [proposition-projective-line-rational-coefficients], the
adjunction $j_!\dashv j^*$ for $\mathbf A^1_V\subset\mathbf P^1_V$, and
Proposition [proposition-composition-open-restriction-compactifications-f]
applied $d$ times. They give $p^!\simeq p^*(d)[2d]$, which preserves
$\Dbc$. For $i$, let $j'$ be the inclusion of the open complement of $U$ in
$\mathbf A^d_V$. The localization triangle before
Example [example-closed-support], with $j'$ in place of $j$, shows that
$i^!K\in\Dbc(U,\Lambda)$ for $K\in\Dbc(\mathbf A^d_V,\Lambda)$. Indeed, its
third term $Rj'_*j'^*K$ is in $\Dbc$ by
Proposition [proposition-direct-image-along-open-immersion], and
$i^*i_*=\mathrm{id}$.
