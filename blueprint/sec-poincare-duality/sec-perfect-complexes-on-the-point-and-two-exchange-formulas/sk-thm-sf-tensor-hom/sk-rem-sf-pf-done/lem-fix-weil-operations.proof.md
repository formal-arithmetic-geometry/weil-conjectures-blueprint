Write $g_X,g_Y$ for the geometric-Frobenius automorphisms of
[def-weil-frobenius-detailed]. For $Rf_*$, define its Weil isomorphism
by

$$
g_Y^*Rf_*K\xrightarrow{\operatorname{Ex}_*}
Rf_*g_X^*K\xrightarrow{Rf_*\theta_K}Rf_*K.
$$

The exchange of [fix-lem-exchanges] is an isomorphism for an
automorphism square: the inverse comes from the inverse square and
their pasting is the identity. The pasting identity proves the
iterate compatibility required by
[def-weil-weil-sheaf-complex]. The same construction with
$\operatorname{Ex}_!$ defines the Weil structure on
[def-compact-support-direct-image-detailed]. Pullback uses
$g_X^*f^*=f^*g_Y^*$. Tensor and internal Hom use the natural
identifications of [def-weil-derived-pullback-tensor-hom]; for
internal Hom the inverse Weil map on its contravariant argument is
used. Since $g^*$ is an equivalence, this Hom identification does
not require a claim that every constructible complex is site-perfect.

For an admissible exceptional adjoint, take the mate of the
$Rf_!$ comparison under [fix-prop-adjunctions]. Inverse
automorphism squares again give its inverse, and mate calculus proves
that its units and counits are equivariant, using the adjoint of
[def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility].
For the ordinary adjunction of [def-weil-derived-direct-image]
the same assertion is the definition of $\operatorname{Ex}_*$.
Evaluation is natural in the two Weil maps and their inverses, so
its square commutes. Composition and exchange use the pasting
identities of [fix-lem-exchanges]; the projection transformation
of [def-exchange-projection] is a composite of precisely these
tensor and counit maps, hence is equivariant as well.
Finally [def-coefficient-twists-detailed] fixes the scalar Frobenius
action on each twist, and tensoring with that scalar respects all
the maps above.
