Let $(S_\lambda)$ be a cofiltered inverse system of schemes with affine
transition maps and limit $S$. Let $g_\lambda\colon Z_\lambda\to Y_\lambda$
be a morphism of finite presentation between $S_\lambda$-schemes, with
$Y_\lambda$ quasi-compact and quasi-separated. If its base change to the
inverse limit $S$ is a closed immersion, then there is
$\mu\geq\lambda$ such that every later base change $g_\nu$ is a closed
immersion.

## Proof

Cover $Y_\lambda$ by finitely many affine opens and cover the inverse images
in $Z_\lambda$ by finitely many affine opens; this is finite because the
morphism is finitely presented. On one such chart write the map as
$B_\lambda\to C_\lambda$ with $C_\lambda$ finitely presented over
$B_\lambda$. After tensoring with the colimit ring, the map
$B\to C$ is surjective. Choose finitely many algebra generators of
$C_\lambda$ over $B_\lambda$. Their images in $C$ have preimages in $B$;
choose representatives of those preimages at a common later stage. The
finitely many equations expressing each generator as such a preimage hold
at one further common stage by
[lemma-nagata-filtered-colimit-finite-data]. Consequently the chart
map is surjective at that stage and at every later stage, hence a closed
immersion on the chart. Repeat for the finite affine chart list and take a
common upper bound. The chartwise closed immersions agree on overlaps (they
are base changes of the same map), so their images glue to a global closed
immersion. Base change of a finite-presentation morphism to a later stage
preserves finite presentation, and the same finite upper-bound argument
proves the assertion for every $\nu\geq\mu$.
