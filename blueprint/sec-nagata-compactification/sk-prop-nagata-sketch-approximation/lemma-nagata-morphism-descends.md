The base change of the constructed
$\varphi_{\lambda_\varphi}$ to $S$ is $\varphi$.

## Proof

The inverse-image opens pull back to the original opens by the quasi-compact
open descent property. On each affine piece, the descended ring map pulls
back to the original map by the affine finite-presentation property. The
selected equality stages make those local maps agree on all overlaps, so
their gluing pulls back to the gluing of the original local maps, namely
$\varphi$.
