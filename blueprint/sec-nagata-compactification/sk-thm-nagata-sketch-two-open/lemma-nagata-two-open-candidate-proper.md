The constructed structural morphism $W\to S$ is proper.

## Proof

The morphism $U_1\cap U_2\to W$ is quasi-compact and dense by
[lemma-nagata-final-density], and its valuation diagrams admit unique
lifts by [lemma-nagata-two-open-valuative-lifting]. The dense-source
valuative criterion makes $W\to S$ universally closed. It is separated
and of finite type by
[lemma-nagata-two-open-final-modification]; hence it is proper.
