Let $A$ be a valuation ring with fraction field $K$. Let
$\operatorname{Spec}(K)\to U_1\cap U_2$ be an $S$-morphism and let
$g_i\colon\operatorname{Spec}(A)\to X_i$ be extensions. At least one
$g_i$ factors through $X_i\setminus\overline Z_{i,j}$, and hence determines
a map $\operatorname{Spec}(A)\to W_i$ extending the given generic map.

## Proof

Otherwise the closed point would map into $\overline Z_{1,2}$ under $g_1$
and into $\overline Z_{2,1}$ under $g_2$. By
[lemma-nagata-valuation-pair-factors-comparison], the pair factors
through $X_{12}$, contradicting
[lemma-nagata-key-boundary-disjointness]. If the closed point avoids
one of the two boundaries, its inverse image of the corresponding open
complement is an open subset of $\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ containing the
closed point. By
[lemma-nagata-valuation-open-closed-point] this open is all of
$\operatorname{Spec}(A)$. The associated $g_i$ therefore factors
through $X_i\setminus\overline Z_{i,j}$, and the open immersion
$X_i\setminus\overline Z_{i,j}\hookrightarrow W_i$ supplies the asserted
extension.
