Fix $\lambda_0\in I$ and a scheme $Y_{\lambda_0}$ equipped with a morphism
to $S_{\lambda_0}$. On the cofinal directed subsystem
$I_{\lambda_0}=\{\lambda\mid\lambda_0\leq\lambda\}$, define

$$
Y_\lambda=Y_{\lambda_0}\times_{S_{\lambda_0}}S_\lambda,
\qquad
Y=Y_{\lambda_0}\times_{S_{\lambda_0}}S.
$$

The transition morphisms $Y_\mu\to Y_\lambda$ for
$\lambda\leq\mu$ are the canonical base changes of the inverse-system
transitions $S_\mu\to S_\lambda$, and the maps $Y\to Y_\lambda$ are the
projections induced by $S\to S_\lambda$.
