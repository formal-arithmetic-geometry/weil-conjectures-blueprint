The ambient scheme $\overline X^{\mathrm{cl}}_f$ is the scheme-theoretic image of the
composite
$X\to X_f^{\mathrm{fp}}\to\overline X_f^{\mathrm{fp}}$. The map
$j^{\mathrm{cl}}_f$ is its canonical image factor and $p^{\mathrm{cl}}_f$ is the restriction of the
ambient structural morphism. These identifications commute with the
displayed factorization over $S$.

## Proof

Unfold $\mathsf{Closed}$ in
[def-nagata-final-compactification]. Its ambient object is defined as
`Scheme.Hom.image` of the stated composite, and its first map is
`Scheme.Hom.toImage`; the factorization equality is
[lemma-nagata-scheme-image-universal]. The last map is obtained by
restricting the already specified map
$\overline X_f^{\mathrm{fp}}\to S$, so the two identifications are
compatible with the structural morphisms by the same factorization
equality.
