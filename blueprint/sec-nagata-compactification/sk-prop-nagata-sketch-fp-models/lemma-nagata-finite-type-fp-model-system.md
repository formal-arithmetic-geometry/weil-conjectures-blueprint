Let $S$ be quasi-compact and quasi-separated and let $f\colon X\to S$ be
quasi-compact and locally of finite type with $X$ quasi-compact and
quasi-separated. Then $X$ admits a closed immersion over $S$ into a scheme
of finite presentation over $S$, and $\mathsf{FP}(X/S)$ is a
finite-presentation approximation of $f$: every $X_\alpha\to S$ is of finite
presentation, every transition map is a closed immersion, every $i_\alpha$
is a closed immersion, and $X\cong\varprojlim_\alpha X_\alpha$ over $S$.

## Proof

The immersion model is of finite presentation over $S$. Since $S$ is
quasi-separated, its source is quasi-separated; the selected open
$Y^\circ$ is quasi-compact and remains of finite presentation over $S$.
The closed-subscheme system then has closed transitions and limit $X$.
Composition of each finite-presentation closed immersion
$X_\alpha\hookrightarrow Y^\circ$ with $Y^\circ\to S$ is of finite
presentation. The canonical maps from the limit are closed immersions
because the transition maps are closed immersions.
