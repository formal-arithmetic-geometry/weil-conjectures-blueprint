The recursively constructed factorization
$\mathsf C_{\mathrm{Noeth}}(X/S)$ is a compactification of $X\to S$.
Consequently $X\to S$ is compactifiable.

## Proof

The final component $h_n$ of the dependent recursive datum in
[def-nagata-noetherian-compactification] has the three fields required
by [def-nagata-compactification], and $X_n=X$. Thus
$\mathsf C_{\mathrm{Noeth}}(X/S)$ is a compactification of $X\to S$. No
later induction theorem is used to define any earlier $\mathsf C_r$.
