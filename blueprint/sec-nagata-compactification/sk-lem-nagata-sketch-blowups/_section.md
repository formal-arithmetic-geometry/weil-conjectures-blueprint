*Lemma (sketch).*

Finite-type ideal blow-ups are proper. Admissible blow-ups can be
composed, refined simultaneously, and extended from a quasi-compact open
to a qcqs ambient scheme while preserving a specified open on which they
are trivial. For $T\to X$ and $b:X'\to X$ with centre $C$, the
*strict transform* of $T$ is the scheme-theoretic closure of
$T\times_X(X\setminus C)$ in $T\times_XX'$; it is the blow-up of $T$
in the pulled-back ideal. Scheme-theoretic density of a quasi-compact preserved open
survives an admissible blow-up.

## Proof

Use the Rees algebra $\bigoplus_{n\geq0}\mathcal I^n$ and its Proj.
For $I=(a_1,\ldots,a_r)$ on $\Spec A$, the charts are
$\Spec A[I/a_i]$; quotienting the pulled-back chart by its
$a_i$-power torsion gives the strict transform. These descriptions
commute with localization. Finite-type ideals extend across
quasi-compact opens; product ideals give common refinements, and the
composition construction combines successive centres. The same charts
show that a scheme-theoretically dense preserved open remains so.
Moreover, choosing a finite-type ideal with zero set exactly
$X\setminus U$ makes $U$ scheme-theoretically dense in its blow-up,
even when $U$ was not dense in $X$.
