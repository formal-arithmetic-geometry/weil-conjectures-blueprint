Let $U\hookrightarrow X$ be a quasi-compact open immersion, let
$Y\to S$ be separated, and let
$U\to X\times_SY$ be a morphism whose first projection is the given open
immersion. If $Z$ is its scheme-theoretic image, then the projection
$Z\to X$ has inverse image $U$ over the open $U\subseteq X$, and this
inverse image maps isomorphically to $U$.

## Proof

By [lemma-nagata-scheme-image-restrict-open], restriction to
$U\times_SY$ commutes with taking the scheme-theoretic image. On this
open target the original map is a section of
$U\times_SY\to U$. That projection is separated, so its section is a
closed immersion. By
[lemma-nagata-scheme-image-of-closed-immersion], its
scheme-theoretic image is canonically its source, compatibly with the
projection to $U$.
