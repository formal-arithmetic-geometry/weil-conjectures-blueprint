*Proposition (sketch).*

A separated finite-type $f:X\to S$ with $S$ qcqs factors as

$$
X\lhook\joinrel\longrightarrow X^{\mathrm{fp}}
\longrightarrow S,
$$

where the first map is a closed immersion and the second is separated
and of finite presentation.

## Proof

Use [sk-prop-nagata-sketch-fp-models]. Separatedness over a fixed
qcqs base is eventually detected in a qcqs inverse system with affine
transitions: after increasing the index the stage is separated
(01ZH). Choose such a stage as $X^{\mathrm{fp}}$;
this is 01ZJ. No finite-presentation hypothesis on the
closed immersion $X\hookrightarrow X^{\mathrm{fp}}$ is required.
