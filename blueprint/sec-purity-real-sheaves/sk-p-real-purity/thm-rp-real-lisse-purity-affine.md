Let $U_0$ be a smooth geometrically connected affine curve and let
$\mathcal G_0$ be a lisse
Weil sheaf on $U_0$ which is
$\iota$-real. Then every irreducible
constituent $\mathcal W$ of $\mathcal G_0$ is
punctually $\iota$-pure of
weight $\dw_\iota(\mathcal W)$, its
determinant weight with
respect to $\iota$.

## Proof

Step 1 (reduction to the semisimple case). Replacing
$\mathcal G_0$ by its semisimplification does not change the local
characteristic polynomials (by the Brauer–Nesbitt argument of
[lem-wf-real-semisimplification]), hence changes neither
$\iota$-reality in the sense of [def-wf-iota-real] nor the
determinant weights of $\mathcal G_0$. The resulting semisimple Weil
representation is geometrically semisimple by
[lem-mg-normal-restriction-semisimple]. We therefore assume that
$\mathcal G_0$ is semisimple, with distinct
determinant weights

$$
\gamma_1>\gamma_2>\cdots>\gamma_r,
$$

and write $\mathcal G_0=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{r}\mathcal G_0(i)$ where
$\mathcal G_0(i)$ is the direct sum of the irreducible constituents
of determinant weight $\gamma_i$, of total rank $r(i)$; note
$\sum_i r(i)=\dim V$.
Step 2 (the global upper and lower bounds). Applying
[lem-rp-upper-bound] to $\mathcal G_0$ (of largest determinant
weight $\gamma_1$) gives, at every closed point $x$ and every
eigenvalue $\alpha$ of $F_x$ on $\mathcal G_{0,\bar x}$,

$$
|\iota(\alpha)|^2\le q_x^{\gamma_1}.
$$

The dual sheaf $\mathcal G_0^\vee$ is also $\iota$-real (its local
eigenvalue multiset is the inverse ([p-linear-spectra]) of the conjugation-stable multiset
of $\mathcal G_0$), has determinant weights $-\gamma_i$ (the
determinant of the dual of a constituent is the dual of its
determinant, of weight $-r\gamma_i$ by
[lem-tw-dual-negation]; the constituents of the dual are the
duals of the constituents), hence largest determinant weight
$-\gamma_r$, and the upper bound of [lem-rp-upper-bound]
applied to $\mathcal G_0^\vee$ gives

$$
|\iota(\alpha^{-1})|^2\le q_x^{-\gamma_r}
\qquad\text{hence}\qquad
|\iota(\alpha)|^2\ge q_x^{\gamma_r}
$$

for every eigenvalue $\alpha$ of $F_x$ on
$\mathcal G_{0,\bar x}$.
Step 3 (the estimates for each isotypic part). Fix $n\ge0$ with
$r(n+1)>0$ (writing $r(i)=0$ for $i>r$). Put

$$
N:=\sum_{i=1}^{n}r(i),\qquad
\mathcal T_0:=\bigwedge\nolimits^{N+1}\mathcal G_0.
$$

By [cor-mg-det-weight-exterior] the determinant weights of
$\mathcal T_0$ are the sums $\sum_{i}n_i\gamma_i$ with
$0\le n_i\le r(i)$ and $\sum_in_i=N+1$, and the maximum of these
is

$$
\gamma_{n+1}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}r(i)\gamma_i,
$$

attained exactly at $n_i=r(i)$ for $i\le n$ and $n_{n+1}=1$;
any other tuple either omits some rank at $i\le n+1$ or uses an
index $i>n+1$, and the weights are strictly decreasing, so the value
is strictly smaller. The sheaf $\mathcal T_0$ is $\iota$-real by
[lem-rp-exterior-reality], so
[lem-rp-upper-bound] applied to it gives, at every closed point
$x$ and every eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $F_x$ on
$\mathcal T_{0,\bar x}$,

$$
|\iota(\lambda)|^2\le
q_x^{\gamma_{n+1}+\sum_{i\le n}r(i)\gamma_i}.
$$

Take the particular eigenvalue

$$
\lambda=\alpha^{(n+1)}_j\cdot
\prod_{i=1}^{n}\prod_{j=1}^{r(i)}\alpha^{(i)}_j,
$$

where the $\alpha^{(i)}_j$ are the eigenvalues (with multiplicity)
of $F_x$ on $\mathcal G_0(i)_{\bar x}$ and
$\alpha^{(n+1)}_j$ is any eigenvalue of $F_x$ on
$\mathcal G_0(n+1)_{\bar x}$: for the admissible tuple
$n_i=r(i)$ ($i\le n$), $n_{n+1}=1$ the corresponding summand of
the direct-sum decomposition of
[lem-mg-exterior-direct-sum], together with
[cor-mg-det-weight-exterior], contains the summand

$$
\mathcal L:=\bigl(\det\mathcal G_0(1)\otimes\cdots\otimes
\det\mathcal G_0(n)\bigr)\otimes\mathcal G_0(n+1),
$$

since the exterior power in maximal degree of a module is its
determinant line; this nonzero summand carries the displayed
eigenvalue $F_x$. Hence

$$
|\iota(\alpha^{(n+1)}_j)|^2
\cdot q_x^{\sum_{i\le n}r(i)\gamma_i}
\le q_x^{\gamma_{n+1}+\sum_{i\le n}r(i)\gamma_i},
$$

because for each $i\le n$ the product

$$
\prod_{j=1}^{r(i)}|\iota(\alpha^{(i)}_j)|^2=q_x^{r(i)\gamma_i}
$$

is the eigenvalue of the local Frobenius on the determinant line of
the isotypic part $\mathcal G_0(i)$, hence of weight
$r(i)\gamma_i$ (by [lem-wf-determinantal-weight-exists] and
[def-wf-determinantal-weight]: the
determinant of an irreducible constituent of weight $\gamma$ is a
rank-one sheaf of weight $r\gamma$, and the determinants of the
constituents tensor up to the determinant of the isotypic part, whose
weights add). Since this holds for every closed point $x$ and
every $j$,

$$
|\iota(\alpha)|^2\le q_x^{\gamma_{n+1}}
$$

for every eigenvalue $\alpha$ of $F_x$ on
$\mathcal G_0(n+1)_{\bar x}$. For the lower bound, apply the same
argument to the dual sheaf $\mathcal G_0^\vee$, whose distinct
determinant weights in decreasing order are
$-\gamma_r>\cdots>-\gamma_1$ and whose isotypic part of weight
$-\gamma_i$ is the dual of $\mathcal G_0(i)$, at the block which is
the dual of $\mathcal G_0(n+1)$ (the $(r-n)$-th block of the dual,
of weight $-\gamma_{n+1}$): the same computation, with
$N^\vee:=\sum_{j=n+2}^{r}r(j)$ and the isotypic parts of the
dual of weights $-\gamma_r,\ldots,-\gamma_{n+2}$, whose determinant
lines have weights $r(j)(-\gamma_j)$ by
[def-wf-determinantal-weight], gives

$$
|\iota(\alpha^{-1})|^2\le q_x^{-\gamma_{n+1}},
\qquad\text{i.e.}\qquad
|\iota(\alpha)|^2\ge q_x^{\gamma_{n+1}}.
$$

So every eigenvalue satisfies
$|\iota(\alpha)|=q_x^{\gamma_{n+1}/2}$, which is the punctual
purity of weight $\gamma_{n+1}$ of
[def-weil-punctual-weights] for the constituents of
$\mathcal G_0(n+1)$.
Step 4 (conclusion). The estimate of Step 3 applies to every $n$
with $r(n+1)>0$, so every isotypic part $\mathcal G_0(i)$ — and
hence every irreducible constituent $\mathcal W$ of
$\mathcal G_0$ — is punctually $\iota$-pure of weight
$\dw_\iota(\mathcal W)=\gamma_i$, as asserted.
