Let $U_0/k_0$ be as in
[def-wf-weil-group], put
$\Pi=\pi_1(U_0\times_{k_0}\overline{k}_0,\bar u)$, and let
$\chi:W(U_0,\bar u)\to E^\times$
be continuous, where $E/\mathbf Q_\ell$ is finite. Choose
$s\in W(U_0,\bar u)$ with $\deg(s)=1$. There are integers
$N,r\geq1$ for which

$$
\lambda:\Pi\longrightarrow E,
\qquad
\lambda(g)=\log(\chi(g)^N),
$$

is a continuous additive character and satisfies

$$
\lambda(sgs^{-1})=\lambda(g)=\lambda(s^{-1}gs)
\qquad(g\in\Pi).
$$

## Proof

The exact sequence of [def-wf-weil-group] makes $\Pi$ a profinite,
hence compact, group, since $\Pi$ is the kernel of the degree map by
[lem-wf-weil-group-exact-sequence]. Therefore
$B=\chi(\Pi)$ is a compact subgroup of
$E^\times$. The normalized valuation
$v_E:E^\times\to\mathbf Z$ is continuous and $\mathbf Z$ is discrete,
so $v_E(B)$ is a finite subgroup of the torsion-free additive group
$\mathbf Z$. Hence $v_E(B)=0$ and
$B\subseteq\mathcal O_E^\times$.

Choose $r$ and $N$ from
[lem-wf-deep-principal-unit-log]. Then
$\chi(g)^N\in1+\mathfrak m_E^r$ for every $g\in\Pi$, so $\lambda$
is defined and continuous. Since the target of $\chi$ is abelian and
the logarithm is a homomorphism on the chosen principal-unit group,

$$
\lambda(gh)=\log(\chi(g)^N\chi(h)^N)
=\lambda(g)+\lambda(h).
$$

Moreover

$$
\chi(sgs^{-1})=\chi(s)\chi(g)\chi(s)^{-1}=\chi(g),
$$

which gives the first invariance identity. Replacing $g$ by
$s^{-1}gs$ gives the second one.
