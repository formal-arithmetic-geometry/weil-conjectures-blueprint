Let $X_0$ be a normal geometrically connected curve over $k_0$, fix
a field embedding $\iota:\Qlb\hookrightarrow\mathbf C$, and let $\mathcal V$ be an
irreducible lisse Weil sheaf of rank $r$. Choose a finite coefficient
field over which its representation is defined, and let $a$ be the
weight of [lem-wf-determinantal-weight-exists], so that the
determinant line
$\det(\mathcal V)$ is
punctually $\iota$-pure of weight
$a$. The *determinantal weight* of $\mathcal V$ is

$$
\dw_\iota(\mathcal V):=\frac{a}{r}.
$$

We use the same
notation for the associated representation $V$.
This number does not depend on the chosen finite coefficient field, by
[lem-wf-determinantal-weight-coefficient-field].
