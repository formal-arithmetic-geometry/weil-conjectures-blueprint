For $f(T)=\sum_{n\ge0}a_nT^n\in\mathbf C[[T]]$, let $R(f)$ be the
supremum of $r\ge0$ such that $\sum_n|a_n|t^n$ converges for every
$0\le t<r$. A nonnegative series has all $a_n\in\mathbf R_{\ge0}$.
Products and exponentials of series with the requisite constant terms
are defined coefficientwise; infinite products are required to be
locally finite in each degree.
