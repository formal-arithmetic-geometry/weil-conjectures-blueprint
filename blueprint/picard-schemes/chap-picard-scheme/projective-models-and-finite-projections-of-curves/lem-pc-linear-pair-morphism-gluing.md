Let $S$ be a standard graded
$k$-algebra, and let $l_0,l_1\in S_1$ satisfy
$D_+(l_0)\cup D_+(l_1)=\operatorname{Proj}(S)$. Then the two affine
descriptions of [def-pc-linear-pair-morphism] agree on the overlap
$D_+(l_0)\cap D_+(l_1)$ and glue to a morphism
$\pi_{l_0,l_1}:\operatorname{Proj}(S)\to\mathbf P^1_k$.

## Proof

Write $X=\operatorname{Proj}(S)$ and $U_i=D_+(l_i)$, and let
$U'_0=D_+(x_0)=\operatorname{Spec}(k[t])$,
$U'_1=D_+(x_1)=\operatorname{Spec}(k[t^{-1}])$ be the standard affine
cover of $\mathbf P^1_k$, so that
$U'_0\cap U'_1=\operatorname{Spec}(k[t,t^{-1}])$
([def-sc-p1-standard]); by [def-pc-proj] the open $U_i$ is the
affine scheme $\operatorname{Spec}(S_{(l_i)})$, and the hypothesis says
$X=U_0\cup U_1$.

*Agreement on the overlap.* Since $l_0,l_1$ are homogeneous of
positive degree and the points of $\operatorname{Proj}(S)$ are prime
ideals, $D_+(l_0l_1)=D_+(l_0)\cap D_+(l_1)$; by [def-pc-proj] the
overlap $U_{01}=U_0\cap U_1$ is the affine scheme
$\operatorname{Spec}(S_{(l_0l_1)})$, and by [def-pc-proj] the
restriction map $S_{(l_0)}\to S_{(l_0l_1)}$ is the graded localization
inverting $l_1/l_0$. Hence the restriction to $U_{01}$ of the first
affine description of [def-pc-linear-pair-morphism] is the morphism
$U_{01}\to U'_0$ corresponding to $k[t]\to S_{(l_0l_1)}$,
$t\mapsto l_1/l_0$; this ring map factors through
$k[t,t^{-1}]\to S_{(l_0l_1)}$, $t\mapsto l_1/l_0$, because $l_1/l_0$ is a
unit of $S_{(l_0l_1)}$, so that restriction is the morphism
$U_{01}\to U'_0\cap U'_1$ given by that ring map. Symmetrically, the
restriction to $U_{01}$ of the second affine description is the morphism
$U_{01}\to U'_0\cap U'_1$ corresponding to
$k[t,t^{-1}]\to S_{(l_0l_1)}$, $t^{-1}\mapsto l_0/l_1$. Since
$t\mapsto l_1/l_0$ and $t^{-1}\mapsto l_0/l_1$ determine one and the same
ring map out of $k[t,t^{-1}]$, the two restrictions are equal.

*Gluing.* A morphism out of $X=U_0\cup U_1$ is determined by its
restrictions to $U_0$ and $U_1$, and a pair of morphisms $f_i:U_i\to \mathbf P^1_k$ agreeing on $U_{01}$ glues to a morphism $f:X\to\mathbf P^1_k$: the underlying map of sets, equal to $f_i$ on $U_i$, is well
defined by the agreement on $U_{01}$; it is continuous because
$f^{-1}(W)=f_0^{-1}(W)\cup f_1^{-1}(W)$ for open $W\subseteq\mathbf P^1_k$;
the map of structure sheaves is obtained by gluing the maps
$f_i^\sharp$ over the cover $U_0,U_1$, which is possible because the
$f_i^\sharp$ agree on $U_{01}$ and $\mathcal O_X$ is a sheaf of rings
([def-pc-scheme]); and the induced maps on stalks are those of
$f_0$ or of $f_1$, hence local. Applying this to the two affine
descriptions gives the required morphism $\pi_{l_0,l_1}$.
