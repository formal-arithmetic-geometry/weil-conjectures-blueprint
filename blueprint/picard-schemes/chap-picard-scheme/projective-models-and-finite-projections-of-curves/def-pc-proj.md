For a nonnegatively graded commutative ring $S$, the scheme
$\operatorname{Proj}(S)$ has as points the homogeneous prime ideals
not containing $S_+$. Its standard open
$D_+(f)=\{\mathfrak p:f\notin\mathfrak p\}$, for homogeneous $f$
of positive degree, is the affine scheme $\operatorname{Spec}(S_{(f)})$;
the restriction maps are the graded localization maps.
Write $V_+(I)$ for the closed set of homogeneous primes containing $I$.
Here $\mathbf P^n_k=\operatorname{Proj}(k[x_0,\ldots,x_n])$, with
each $x_i$ of degree one.
