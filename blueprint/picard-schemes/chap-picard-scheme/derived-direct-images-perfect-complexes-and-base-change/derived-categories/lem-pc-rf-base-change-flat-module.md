Let $f:X\to S$ be a quasi-compact separated morphism of schemes,
and let $\mathcal G$ be a quasi-coherent $\mathcal O_X$-module flat
over $S$. For every $g:T\to S$, derived pullback gives an isomorphism

$$
Lg^*Rf_*\mathcal G\;\cong\;Rf_{T,*}\mathcal G_T.
$$

## Proof

The claim is local on $S$ and $T$, so write
$S=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ and $T=\operatorname{Spec}(B)$.
Choose a finite affine cover of $X$ with affine intersections.
By [lem-pc-cech-resolution], its bounded Cech complex $K^\bullet$
computes $Rf_*\mathcal G$. Each term is a finite product of modules
$N_J=\Gamma(U_J,\mathcal G)$ flat over $A$: relative flatness can
be checked on affine charts and localization at primes.
$K^\bullet$ is a bounded complex of flat modules, so by
[lem-pc-flat-complex-derived-pullback] it computes the derived
pullback, and $K^\bullet\otimes_A B$ computes $Lg^*Rf_*\mathcal G$.
The pullback cover of $X_T$ is again affine with affine intersections,
and $\Gamma(U_J\times_S T,\mathcal G_T)=N_J\otimes_A B$.
Its restriction maps are the tensor products of the original maps,
so this is precisely the same Cech complex $K^\bullet\otimes_A B$.
Another application of [lem-pc-cech-resolution] proves the
claimed isomorphism, induced by the canonical base-change map.
