Let $(\mathcal C,F)$ be a Galois category, $G=\operatorname{Aut}(F)$ and
$X$ connected. Then $G$ acts transitively on $F(X)$.

## Proof

We use the axioms of [def-galois-category] throughout.

*Step 1: the directed system of Galois objects.* Let $I$ be the set of
isomorphism classes of Galois objects, choose representatives $X_i$ and
elements $\gamma_i\in F(X_i)$. Write $i\ge i'$ if there is a morphism
$f_{ii'}:X_i\to X_{i'}$; post-composing with an automorphism of $X_{i'}$ we
may assume $F(f_{ii'})(\gamma_i)=\gamma_{i'}$, and then $f_{ii'}$ is unique
by [lem-galois-axioms](5). The set $I$ is directed: for $i_1,i_2$ apply
[lem-galois-object-exists] to a connected component of
$X_{i_1}\times X_{i_2}$.

*Step 2: $F$ is the colimit of the representable functors of the $X_i$.*
Let $F'(X)=\varinjlim_I\operatorname{Mor}_{\mathcal C}(X_i,X)$ and define
$t_X(f)=F(f)(\gamma_i)$. Then $t_X$ is injective by
[lem-galois-axioms](5). For surjectivity let $\gamma\in F(X)$; by axiom (2)
we may assume $X$ connected, hence Galois by
[lem-galois-object-exists], so $X\cong X_i$ for some $i$, and choosing the
isomorphism carrying $\gamma_i$ to $\gamma$ (possible since $X$ is Galois)
exhibits $\gamma$ in the image. Hence $t$ is an isomorphism.

*Step 3: the group of the system.* Put $A_i=\operatorname{Aut}(X_i)$. For
$i\ge i'$ there is a unique homomorphism $h_{ii'}:A_i\to A_{i'}$ with
$f_{ii'}\circ a=h_{ii'}(a)\circ f_{ii'}$ for all $a\in A_i$, defined by
$F(h_{ii'}(a))(\gamma_{i'})=F(f_{ii'}\circ a)(\gamma_i)$ and
[lem-galois-axioms](5); the $h$ are compatible and $A_i\to A_{i'}$ is
surjective because $F(X_i)\to F(X_{i'})$ is surjective and $X_{i'}$ is
Galois. Let $A=\varprojlim_IA_i$, profinite by
[lem-galois-aut-profinite] or directly as a limit of finite groups. It acts
on the system $(X_i)$ and hence on $F'$ by precomposition, giving
$A^{\mathrm{op}}\to G$. Since $A\to A_i$ is surjective, $G$ acts
transitively on $F(X_i)$ for every $i$.

*Step 4: conclusion.* Every connected object is dominated by some $X_i$
([lem-galois-object-exists]), and a morphism $X_i\to X$ of connected
objects is an epimorphism inducing a surjection $F(X_i)\to F(X)$;
transitivity on $F(X_i)$ therefore implies transitivity on $F(X)$.
