Let $S'\to S$ be finite, surjective and radicial, and let
$j:X\hookrightarrow Y$ be an open immersion of finite-type $S$-schemes with
a constructible finite sheaf $F$ on $X$. Suppose the direct image after base
change to $S'$ is bounded constructible and its formation commutes with
every further base change from a Noetherian scheme. Then the same assertions
hold over $S$.

## Proof

Pullback by a universal homeomorphism is an exact equivalence of étale
topoi. It preserves constructibility in both directions: the underlying
spaces are homeomorphic, and finite locally constant sheaves correspond on
every stratum under that equivalence. The equivalence intertwines the
direct-image functor for $j$ with the corresponding functor for its
pullback, including their derived functors. Therefore it detects boundedness
and constructibility of $Rj_*F$.

For any Noetherian $T$ and morphism $T\to S$, the pullback
$T'=T\times_SS'\to T$ is again a universal homeomorphism. Pull back the
proposed exchange morphism to $Y_{T'}$. Compatibility of exchange with
composition identifies it, through the same equivalences, with the exchange
over $S'$, which is an isomorphism by hypothesis. The pullback equivalence
is conservative, so the original exchange is an isomorphism.
