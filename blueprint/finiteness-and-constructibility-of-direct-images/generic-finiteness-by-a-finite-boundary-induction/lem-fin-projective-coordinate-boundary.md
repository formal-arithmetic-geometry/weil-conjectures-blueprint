Let $S=\operatorname{Spec}A$ be integral Noetherian and let $Y\to S$ be
projective. Choose a finite affine cover
$Y_\alpha\hookrightarrow\mathbf A^{m_\alpha}_S$, with $m_\alpha\geq1$, and a
dense open $V_{\alpha r}\subset\mathbf A^1_S$ for each coordinate. After
restriction to a nonempty open of $S$, the reduced closed complement $Z$ of
$\bigcup_{\alpha,r}t_{\alpha r}^{-1}(V_{\alpha r})$ is finite over $S$.

## Proof

The ideal defining $\mathbf A^1_S\setminus V_{\alpha r}$ contains a nonzero
polynomial $P_{\alpha r}\in A[t]$. Invert the finitely many nonzero leading
coefficients and divide by them, making these polynomials monic. On the
reduced scheme $Z\cap Y_\alpha$, every $P_{\alpha r}(t_{\alpha r})$
vanishes: it vanishes at all points and the coordinate ring is reduced.
Hence $Z\cap Y_\alpha$ is closed in
$$
\operatorname{Spec}A[t_1,\dots,t_{m_\alpha}]/(P_{\alpha1}(t_1),\dots,P_{\alpha m_\alpha}(t_{m_\alpha})).
$$
This algebra is finite over $A$, since products of powers below the
respective degrees generate it. Thus every geometric fibre of every
$Z\cap Y_\alpha$ has finitely many points. The cover is finite, so the
fibres of $Z\to S$ are finite.

As a closed subscheme of the projective $Y$, $Z$ is projective; the theorem
that a projective morphism with finite fibres is finite proves finiteness.
