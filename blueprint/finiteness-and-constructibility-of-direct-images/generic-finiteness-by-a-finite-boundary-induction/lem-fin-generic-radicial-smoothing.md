Let $S$ be integral of finite type over a field and let $X\to S$ be of
finite type with $X\ne\varnothing$. After shrinking $S$, there is a finite
radicial surjection $S'\to S$ such that $(X_{S'})_{\mathrm{red}}$ has a
dense open $V$ smooth over $S'$. For a constructible finite sheaf $F$ on
$X$, one may require its pullback to $V$ to be locally constant. Every
component of the complement in the generic fibre then has dimension strictly
smaller than the dimension of the component of $X_{S'}$ that contains it.

## Proof

Write $K=k(S)$. In characteristic zero put $K'=K$. In characteristic $p>0$,
pass first to the perfect closure $K^{\mathrm{perf}}$. The reduced
finite-type $K^{\mathrm{perf}}$-scheme
$(X_{K^{\mathrm{perf}}})_{\mathrm{red}}$ has a dense smooth open. Indeed, at
every generic point choose a separating transcendence basis of its finitely
generated residue field over the perfect field; a primitive element for the
remaining finite separable extension has nonzero derivative. Inverting that
derivative and the finitely many denominators in a finite presentation gives
a smooth neighborhood by the Jacobian criterion. The neighborhoods cover all
generic points.

This construction uses finitely many coefficients: generators of the
nilpotent ideal defining the reduction, equations for the finitely many
chosen open neighborhoods, and the indicated Jacobian identities. They lie
in a finite purely inseparable extension $K'/K$. Enlarging $K'$ once more if
necessary, the descended ideal is nilpotent (use one common power for its
finitely many generators), and the descended opens are smooth by the same
Jacobian identities. Their union contains every generic point, since this
can be checked after the faithfully flat field extension to
$K^{\mathrm{perf}}$. The quotient by the descended nilpotent ideal agrees
with the reduction on these opens, because a smooth algebra over a field is
reduced. Thus $(X_{K'})_{\mathrm{red}}$ has the desired dense smooth open.

Choose an affine open $S=\operatorname{Spec}A$, and generators
$a_1,\dots,a_s$ of $K'/K$ with $a_i^{p^e}\in K$ for one common $e$. Invert
the denominators of these powers. Then $A'=A[a_1,\dots,a_s]\subset K'$ is
finite over $A$. The equations $T_i^{p^e}-a_i^{p^e}$ show that each
geometric fibre has at most one point; integrality gives a point in every
fibre. Hence $\operatorname{Spec}A'\to\operatorname{Spec}A$ is finite,
surjective and radicial.

Spread the finitely presented generic smooth neighborhoods by clearing their
denominators. Remove the closures in $S$ of the images of any remaining
vertical irreducible components of $Y$. These images have nondense closures,
so this removes no generic point of $S$; and because $S'\to S$ is a
homeomorphism on underlying spaces it removes no generic point of $S'$
either. Write $S_1\subseteq S$ for the surviving open and
$S'_1=S'\times_SS_1$, so that $S'_1\to S_1$ is again finite, surjective and
radicial, and still a homeomorphism on underlying spaces; the shrinking is
therefore performed on the base, and the descent step below may use it. The
resulting smooth open is dense in $(X_{S'_1})_{\mathrm{red}}$.

At each of its finitely many generic points the constructible stratification
supplies an open neighborhood on which $F$ is locally constant. Intersect
with their union. The complement contains no generic point of any component
of the generic fibre. A proper closed subset of an irreducible finite-type
scheme over a field has strictly smaller dimension, which proves the last
assertion.
