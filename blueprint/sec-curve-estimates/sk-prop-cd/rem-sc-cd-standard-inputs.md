Four standard facts are used in the proofs above; each is either basic
mathematics, which the decomposition rules allow to be quoted, or a
theorem of this blueprint, and we record them here so that no step of the
argument is left implicit.

1. A finite morphism has exact direct image with no higher direct
images, and its direct image preserves injective sheaves because its
inverse image is exact and left adjoint to it; this is
[lemma-weil-pbc-finite-direct-image-exact], and it is used in the
dimension-zero case and in the reduction by Noether normalization.
1. A separably closed residue field and a polynomial with a simple root
there admit a unique lift of that root, by the Hensel lifting lemma
for a strict henselian local ring; the simplicity is supplied by the
discriminant, a nonzero element of the coefficient field and hence a
unit in the strict local ring. This is the local-algebra input of
the strict-local dimension-drop computation.
1. Vanishing of all geometric stalks of an etale sheaf forces the sheaf
to vanish; this is
[lemma-weil-pbc-geometric-stalk-conservative], and it is what
converts the stalkwise bounds above into the stated vanishing of
$R^qj_*M$ and of $H^q(X,F)$.
1. For a finite-type algebra over a field, the transcendence degree of
the residue field at a point bounds its local dimension, and a
proper closed subset of an irreducible finite-type scheme has
strictly smaller dimension; these are the dimension statements used
when the support of $R^qf_*M$ is bounded by the transcendence
degree and when only the generic point of $\mathbf A^{d-1}_K$ has
transcendence degree $d-1$.

All four are standard, and the first and the third are proved in this
blueprint; none of them is a finiteness or constructibility statement, so
no circularity with the later direct-image theory arises.
