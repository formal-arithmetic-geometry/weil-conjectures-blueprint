Let $r\ge0$. A field $K$ is *$C_r$* if every homogeneous
polynomial form $F\in K[x_1,\dots,x_N]$ of degree $d>0$ in
$N>d^{\,r}$ variables has a nontrivial zero in $K^N$, i.e. there is
$x\in K^N$ with $x\ne0$ and $F(x)=0$.

For $r=1$ — the only case used below — this reads: every
homogeneous form of degree $d$ in $N>d$ variables has a nontrivial
zero. For $r=0$ the condition is $N>1$, so an algebraically closed
field is $C_0$, and $C_0\Rightarrow C_1$.
