Let $g:T\to S$ be a morphism of schemes and let $E$ be a bounded above
complex of flat $\mathcal{O}_S$-modules. Then the derived pullback $Lg^*E$
of [def-pc-derived-pullback] is represented by the complex $g^*E$ obtained
by pulling $E$ back term by term: the canonical map $g^*E\to Lg^*E$ is a
quasi-isomorphism.

## Proof

By [def-pc-derived-pullback],
$Lg^*E=\mathcal{O}_T\otimes^{\mathbf L}_{g^{-1}\mathcal{O}_S}g^{-1}E$, and
this derived tensor product is computed by a K-flat resolution of
$g^{-1}E$. Inverse image along a morphism of schemes is exact and preserves
flatness, so $g^{-1}E$ is a bounded above complex of flat
$g^{-1}\mathcal{O}_S$-modules; a bounded above complex of flat modules over
a ringed space is K-flat (Cohomology of Sheaves, Lemma 20.26.9, [Tag
06YD](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/06YD)). Hence $g^{-1}E$ is a
K-flat resolution of itself and
$$
Lg^*E=\mathcal{O}_T\otimes_{g^{-1}\mathcal{O}_S}g^{-1}E=g^*E,
$$
which is the termwise pullback of $E$, as claimed.
