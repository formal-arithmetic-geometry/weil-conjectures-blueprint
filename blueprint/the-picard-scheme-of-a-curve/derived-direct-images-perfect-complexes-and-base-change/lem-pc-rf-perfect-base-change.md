Let $S$ be a scheme, $f:X\to S$ a proper morphism of finite presentation,
and let $\mathcal{G}$ be an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module of finite presentation
and flat over $S$. Then $Rf_*\mathcal{G}$ is a perfect object of
$D(\mathcal{O}_S)$, and its formation commutes with arbitrary base change:
for every morphism $g:T\to S$ the canonical map
$$
Lg^*(Rf_*\mathcal{G})\;\longrightarrow\;Rf_{T,*}\mathcal{G}_T
$$
is an isomorphism in $D(\mathcal{O}_T)$.

## Proof

The base-change assertion is [lem-pc-rf-base-change-flat-module]; proper
morphisms are quasi-compact and separated. If the base is locally
Noetherian and $f$ is projective, the perfectness assertion follows from
[lem-pc-projective-noetherian-rf-perfect].

For a general proper $f$ of finite presentation the perfectness assertion
is the recorded classical input: Derived Categories of Schemes, Lemma
36.30.4 ([Tag 0B91](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0B91)) reads, in
clause (2), "Let $S$ be a scheme. Let $f:X\to S$ be a proper morphism of
finite presentation. … Let $\mathcal{G}$ be an $\mathcal{O}_X$-module of
finite presentation, flat over $S$. Then $Rf_*\mathcal{G}$ is a perfect
object of $D(\mathcal{O}_S)$ and its formation commutes with arbitrary base
change.", which is this lemma; its proof is the cohomology-and-base-change
theorem of the same section (Lemma 36.30.1, [Tag
0A1H](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0A1H)), not decomposed here.
