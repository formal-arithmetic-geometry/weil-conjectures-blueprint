Let $k$ be an infinite field and $X$ a projective
[def-pc-projective-morphism] curve [def-pc-curve] over $k$. There exists a
finite [def-pc-morphism-conventions] morphism $X\to\mathbf P^1_k$.

## Proof

Choose a closed immersion $X\hookrightarrow\mathbf P^n_k$ from
[def-pc-projective-morphism]. The coordinate model
[lem-pc-projective-coordinate-model] identifies $X$ with
$\operatorname{Proj}(S)$ for an integral standard graded algebra. Choose
$l_0,l_1$ by [lem-pc-projective-curve-linear-pair] and form
$\pi_{l_0,l_1}$ as in [def-pc-linear-pair-morphism], which exists by
[lem-pc-linear-pair-morphism-gluing]. It is finite by
[lem-pc-linear-pair-morphism-finite].
