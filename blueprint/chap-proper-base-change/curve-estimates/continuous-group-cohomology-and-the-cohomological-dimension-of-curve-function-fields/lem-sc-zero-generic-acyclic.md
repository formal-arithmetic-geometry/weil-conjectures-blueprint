Let $C$ be an integral separated
curve over an algebraically closed field,
and let $F$ be a torsion etale
sheaf whose restriction to the generic point is zero.
Then $H^q(C,F)=0$ for all $q>0$, in the sense of
[def-weil-pbc-etale-cohomology].

## Proof

For a finite set $S$ of closed points let $j_S:C\setminus S\to C$
and put $F_S=\ker(F\to j_{S*}j_S^*F)$.
We claim $F=\varinjlim_S F_S$.
Represent a section on a quasi-compact etale object $V\to C$.
On each of the finitely many irreducible components of $V$
its generic germ is zero. The definition of a geometric stalk
provides an etale neighborhood on which the section is zero.
The image of that neighborhood is open; the sheaf axiom implies
vanishing on the image. Thus the section vanishes off a finite
closed subset of $V$. Its image in $C$ is contained in a finite
set of closed points: a point of $V$ mapping to the generic point of
$C$ lies in the fibre $V_\eta$, which is zero-dimensional because
$V\to C$ is quasi-finite, and on the corresponding finite etale piece
$\operatorname{Spec}L\to\eta$ the sections are
$F_\eta\otimes_AL=0$, the generic stalk $F_\eta$ vanishing by
hypothesis, so the section vanishes there as well; the remaining
points of its non-vanishing locus are closed points whose image in
$C$ is closed too. The
section consequently belongs to $F_S(V)$ for some $S$.
This proves the claim on a basis, or on geometric stalks using
[prop-weil-pbc-geometric-stalks-exact].

For $i_S:S\to C$, the map $F_S\to i_{S*}i_S^*F_S$ is an
isomorphism: at a point of $S$ it is the identity, and outside
$S$ both stalks vanish. Finite direct image is exact by
[lemma-weil-pbc-finite-direct-image-exact], so its cohomology
is the cohomology on $S$. That is zero in positive degrees
by [lem-weil-pbc-zero-dimensional-cohomology], since
$S$ is a finite disjoint union of spectra of algebraically
closed fields. Finally use
[lem-weil-pbc-cohomology-filtered-colimit].
