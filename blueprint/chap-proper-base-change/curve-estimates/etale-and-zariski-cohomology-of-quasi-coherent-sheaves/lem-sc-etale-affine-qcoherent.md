Let $X$ be an affine scheme and $\mathcal F$ a quasi-coherent module.
Then $H^q(X_{\mathrm{et}},\mathcal F_{\mathrm{et}})=0$ for $q>0$,
with the associated sheaf of
Definition [def-sc-etale-qcoherent-module].

## Proof

We induct on $q$, simultaneously for all affine schemes and all
quasi-coherent modules. A class in positive sheaf cohomology
vanishes on some covering: using an injective resolution, represent
it by a cocycle; exactness of that resolution as a complex of sheaves
means this cocycle is locally a boundary. Refine the resulting
etale covering by affine opens. Since etale maps are open and $X$
is quasi-compact, finitely many such affine opens cover $X$.
Their disjoint union $V=\operatorname{Spec}(B)$ gives a faithfully
flat etale map to $X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$.

All iterated fibre products $V\times_X\cdots\times_XV$ are affine.
Their sections of the sheaf of [def-sc-etale-qcoherent-module]
are $M\otimes_A B^{\otimes_A(p+1)}$, where $\mathcal F=\widetilde M$.
The associated Cech complex is exact in positive degrees by
[lem-pc-cech-exact]. For $q=1$, the Cech-to-cohomology
spectral sequence of [lem-sc-cech-spectral] identifies the
kernel of restriction to $V$ with a quotient of this zero Cech
cohomology group. Hence the class is zero.
For $q>1$, the induction hypothesis kills every row of that
spectral sequence with cohomology degree strictly between $0$ and
$q$. Our class restricts to zero on $V$, so its only possible
filtration piece comes from the degree-$q$ Cech cohomology in row
zero. That group is again zero. This proves the induction.
