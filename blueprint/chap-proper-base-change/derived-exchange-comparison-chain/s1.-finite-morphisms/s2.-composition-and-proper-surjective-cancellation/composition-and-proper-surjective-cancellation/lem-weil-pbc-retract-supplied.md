Let $f:X\to Y$ be proper and surjective, let $I$ be injective on $Y_{\Et}$,
and choose a monomorphism $f^{-1}I\hookrightarrow J$ with $J$ injective on
$X_{\Et}$. The adjoint map

$$
 I\longrightarrow f_*J
$$

of the direct image adjunction is a monomorphism. Injectivity of $I$ supplies
a retraction $f_*J\to I$, so $I$ is a direct summand of $f_*J$.

## Proof

At a geometric point $\bar y\to Y$, choose a geometric point $\bar x\to X$
above it, possible by surjectivity on geometric points. Composing the stalk
map $I_{\bar y}\to(f_*J)_{\bar y}$ with restriction to $J_{\bar x}$ gives the
inclusion $I_{\bar y}=(f^{-1}I)_{\bar x}\hookrightarrow J_{\bar x}$, so the
stalk map is a monomorphism; by conservativity of geometric stalks, the map
itself is a monomorphism. Since $I$ is injective, the monomorphism splits,
which is the assertion.
