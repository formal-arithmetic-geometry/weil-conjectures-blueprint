Let $u:X_0\to X$ be a universal homeomorphism. Pullback along $u$ is an
equivalence between the small etale topos of $X$ and that of $X_0$, and for
every abelian sheaf $F$ on $X_{\mathrm{et}}$ and every $n$ it induces an
isomorphism

$$
H^n(X_{\mathrm{et}},F)\xrightarrow{\sim}H^n(X_{0,\mathrm{et}},u^{-1}F).
$$

This is Tag `03SI`.

## Proof

Base change is an equivalence of the underlying categories and matches the
covering families, hence is an equivalence of sites; so restriction along it
is an equivalence of the categories of sheaves, and pullback, being its left
adjoint, is a quasi-inverse. Cohomology is the $\operatorname{Ext}$-groups
out of the constant sheaf $\mathbf Z$, and an exact equivalence carrying the
constant sheaf to the constant sheaf induces an isomorphism on those groups.
