For a quasi-compact and quasi-separated morphism of schemes $h:W\to V$ and a
filtered system of torsion sheaves $(F_i)$, the canonical map

$$
\varinjlim_i R^qh_*F_i\longrightarrow R^qh_*(\varinjlim_iF_i)
$$

is an isomorphism for every $q$.

## Proof

For $q=0$, sections on a quasi-compact etale object are the equalizer of a
finite covering diagram after a finite quasi-compact refinement; filtered
colimits commute with this finite limit. For $q>0$, represent a class by a
degree-$q$ cocycle on a split etale hypercover with finite $(q+1)$-skeleton.
Each of its finitely many sections is represented in some $F_i$, and the
finite list of face-map equalities holds at one later index because the system
is filtered. This proves surjectivity of
$\varinjlim_iH^q(W,F_i)\to H^q(W,\varinjlim_iF_i)$.

If a class from $F_i$ dies after the colimit, choose a finite hypercover
refinement and a degree-$(q-1)$ null-homotopy on the limit. Its finitely many
sections, refinement maps, and equations descend to one index $j\geq i$;
there the class is already a coboundary. Thus the map is injective. The
same argument applies after every quasi-compact etale base change
$U\to V$, so the cohomology-sheaf description of $R^qh_*$ identifies the
displayed sheaves. This is the derived filtered-colimit argument, with no
unbounded injective replacement required.
