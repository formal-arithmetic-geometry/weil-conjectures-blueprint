Write $A_\infty=R\varprojlim A_n$ and likewise for the other three towers,
and write $H,V,H',V'$ for the limits of $h,v,h',v'$. Then

$$
V'H=H'V:A_\infty\longrightarrow D_\infty.
$$

For every $n$, both maps have the same $n$th component

$$
\operatorname{pr}_{D,n}V'H
=v'_nh_n\operatorname{pr}_{A,n}
=h'_nv_n\operatorname{pr}_{A,n}
=\operatorname{pr}_{D,n}H'V.
$$

The equality is natural for compatible tower endomorphisms.

## Proof

Transition compatibility makes each family a map between the product-cone
diagrams. On both product terms, the $n$th coordinate of $V'H$ is
$v'_nh_n$, while that of $H'V$ is $h'_nv_n$; these are equal by the
finite-level rectangle. Hence the product maps, their $1-\mathrm{shift}$
squares, and the induced maps on the fibres are equal. This proves both the
limit equality and the three displayed component equations. Operator
naturality holds on every product coordinate, so it also holds on the fibre.
