Let $S$ be a scheme, let $Y_1,\dots,Y_m$ be schemes over $S$ and let
$f_i\colon T\to Y_i$ be morphisms of $S$-schemes. If some $f_k$ is an
immersion, then

$$
(f_1,\dots,f_m)\colon T\longrightarrow Y_1\times_S\dots\times_S Y_m
$$

is an immersion.

## Proof

Composing $(f_1,\dots,f_m)$ with the projection $\mathrm{pr}_k$ gives back
$f_k$, which is an immersion; hence $(f_1,\dots,f_m)$ is an immersion, because
if a composition $h\circ g$ is an immersion then so is $g$.

(The blueprint originally deduced this from 01KR by factoring
$(f_1,\dots,f_m)$ through $T\times_S Y_2\times_S\dots\times_S Y_m$, which also
requires the $Y_i$ to be separated over $S$. The argument above needs neither.)
