Let $C_0$ be a smooth geometrically connected curve and let
$\mathcal F$ be a lisse Weil sheaf that is punctually $\iota$-pure of
weight $w$. Then every $H_c^r(C,\mathcal F)$ has weights at most
$w+r$.

## Proof

Apply [prop-a1-middle-extension-curve-upper] to the identity open
immersion $C_0\hookrightarrow C_0$; its middle extension is
$\mathcal F$ itself, giving the bound $H_c^r(C,\mathcal F)\leq w+r$.
