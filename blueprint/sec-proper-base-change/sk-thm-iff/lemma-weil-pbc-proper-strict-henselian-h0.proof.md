Write $k=A/\mathfrak m$ and $Z_0=Z\times_SS_0$ with $S_0=\Spec k$, so that
$Z_0\subset Z$ is the closed member of the pair $(\mathfrak m)$. The proof
has four steps.

*Step 1: the geometric fiber and the closed fiber agree.* By
[def-weil-pbc-henselian-terminology] a strictly henselian local ring is
henselian local, so $(A,\mathfrak m)$ is a henselian pair, and its residue
field $k$ is separably closed. The closed geometric point $s$ is a geometric
point lying over $S_0$; we take it in the standard normalization, $s:\Spec
k^{\mathrm{alg}}\to S$ with $k^{\mathrm{alg}}$ the algebraic closure of $k$
(any other geometric point over the same closed point of $S_0$ with
transcendental field of constants would give a different statement for
general etale sheaves, e.g. for $F=\mathbf G_m$ on a point, so the comparison
below is the one for the canonical choice; this is the convention of the
Stacks Project comparison, Tag
[0A0C](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0A0C), which is stated for the
closed member of the henselian pair, and the geometric-point formulation
below is only the transport of that statement). Since $k$ is separably
closed, every element of $k^{\mathrm{alg}}$ is purely inseparable over $k$
(the separable closure of $k$ is $k$ itself), so $\Spec k^{\mathrm{alg}}\to
\Spec k$ is a universal homeomorphism (it is surjective, integral, and
radicial); base changes of universal homeomorphisms are universal
homeomorphisms ([lem-weil-pbc-universal-homeomorphism-base-change]), hence
$Z_s=Z\times_S\Spec k^{\mathrm{alg}}\to Z_0$ is one. By
[thm-weil-pbc-universal-homeomorphism-invariance] the small etale sites of
$Z_s$ and $Z_0$ are corresponding, carrying $F|_{Z_0}$ to $F|_{Z_s}$, so
$\Gamma(Z_s,F|_{Z_s})=\Gamma(Z_0,F|_{Z_0})$ canonically. It is therefore
enough to compute $\Gamma(Z_0,F|_{Z_0})$.

*Step 2: apply the henselian-pair comparison* (this is Stacks Project, Tag
[0A0C](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0A0C), Lemma 59.91.2). The two
hypotheses of [lemma-weil-pbc-etale-degree-zero] hold verbatim: $(A,\mathfrak
m)$ is a henselian pair by Step 1, and $p:Z\to S$ is proper by hypothesis.
Its conclusion: for every etale abelian sheaf $F$ on $Z$ the restriction map

$$
 \Gamma(Z,F)\xrightarrow{\sim}\Gamma(Z_0,F|_{Z_0})
$$

is an isomorphism. With the identification of Step 1 this is the asserted
isomorphism $\Gamma(Z,F)\xrightarrow{\sim}\Gamma(Z_s,F|_{Z_s})$.

*Step 3: the content of the cited comparison.* It is useful to see where
[lemma-weil-pbc-etale-degree-zero] gets its statement, since its hypotheses
coincide with the present ones. In Stage 1 of its proof, the connectedness
conclusion of [lemma-weil-pbc-stein-connectedness] (applied to the proper $Z\to
S$), together with the spectrality of $Z$ and closedness of $Z_0\subset Z$
(as in [def-weil-pbc-scheme-conventions], since $Z$ is proper over the affine
$S$), is the hypothesis of [lemma-weil-pbc-spectral-restriction], which then
identifies sections of every locally constant
[def-weil-pbc-etale-sheaves] Zariski sheaf on $Z$ with its sections on $Z_0$;
the extension of this identification to the constructible sheaf actually used
is the open item recorded in the status note to
[lemma-weil-pbc-stein-connectedness]. In Stage 2 the finite refinements of
[lemma-weil-pbc-finite-refinement-etale-cover], together with
[lem-weil-pbc-finite-pullback-identities], carry an etale section from a
neighbourhood of $Z_0$ to the finite covers of $Z$ on which Stage 1 applies,
producing an etale section of $F$ with prescribed restriction. Thus the two
stages constitute exactly the comparison of Step 2, and no other input is
used.

*Step 4: naturality and finite pullback.* The comparison is natural in $F$:
the identification of Step 1 and both stages of Step 3 are functorial in the
sheaf. It is natural in finite pullback over $S$. Let $h:Z'\to Z$ be finite.
The composite $Z'\to S$ is proper (the composite of the proper $h$, as finite
morphisms are proper, with the proper $p$), so
[lemma-weil-pbc-etale-degree-zero] applies to $Z'$ as well and gives the
comparison for $\Gamma(Z',h^{-1}F)$; by the naturality in finite pullback
recorded in [lemma-weil-pbc-etale-degree-zero] (and transported through the
identifications of Step 1), the comparison for $Z$, the comparison for $Z'$,
and the finite pullbacks form a commutative square. This proves the
assertion.

We first prove the corresponding assertion for Zariski sheaves, uniformly
after every finite $T'\to T$. The space $T'$ is spectral and $T'\to \operatorname{Spec}A$ is proper. For an irreducible closed reduced
$C\subset T'$, Stein factorization gives

$$
C\longrightarrow\operatorname{Spec}B\longrightarrow
\operatorname{Spec}A,
$$

where $A\to B$ is integral and the first map has geometrically connected
fibres. The pair $(B,\mathfrak mB)$ is henselian: an idempotent of a finite
$B$-algebra modulo $\mathfrak m$ satisfies $e^2-e=0$, and the simple roots
$0,1$ lift uniquely by the henselian property of $A$ after restriction of
scalars along the integral algebra $B$. Consequently the closed subset
$\operatorname{Spec}B\cap V(\mathfrak m)$ is connected and nonempty. Its
inverse image $C\cap T'_0$ is connected because the map is closed,
surjective onto its image, and has connected fibres.

For completeness, let $G$ be a Zariski sheaf on $T'$. Every point
specializes to $T'_0$, so a global section is determined by its restriction.
For existence, write $G$ as the filtered union of subsheaves generated by
finitely many sections on quasi-compact opens. Such a finitely generated
subsheaf embeds into a finite product
$\prod_b(i_b)_*\underline{M_b}$, where $i_b:C_b\hookrightarrow T'$ is
closed and $M_b$ is a finite set: take the finitely many values of the
generators and separate their equalizer loci. Sections of
$(i_b)_*\underline{M_b}$ are locally constant maps $C_b\to M_b$.
Connectedness of every $C\cap T'_0$ says that the connected components of
$C_b$ and $C_b\cap T'_0$ correspond, so such maps extend uniquely. Finite
products, intersections with the embedded subsheaf, and filtered colimits
preserve this equality of section sets. Thus
$\Gamma(T',G)=\Gamma(T'_0,G|)$ for every Zariski sheaf and every finite
$T'\to T$.

Now let $E$ be an etale sheaf. The map from the restriction to the Zariski
site followed by closed-fibre inverse image to the Zariski restriction of
$E|_{T_0}$ is stalkwise injective. Indeed, an elementary etale
neighbourhood $V\to T$ whose closed fibre has a local section has open image
$V_0\subset T$, and $V\to V_0$ is an etale cover; hence

$$
E(V_0)\longrightarrow E(V)
\rightrightarrows E(V\times_{V_0}V)
$$

is an equalizer. Taking the colimit over such neighbourhoods proves the
stalkwise injection. The Zariski result therefore proves injectivity of
$\Gamma(T,E)\to\Gamma(T_0,E|)$, and the same argument applies after every
finite $T'\to T$.

For surjectivity, take $t_0\in\Gamma(T_0,E|)$. By the definition of inverse
image and sheafification there are finitely many etale maps $V_a\to T_0$
covering $T_0$, etale $U_a\to T$, maps $V_a\to U_a\times_TT_0$, and
sections $s_a\in E(U_a)$ representing $t_0|_{V_a}$. Shrink $U_a$ to the
open image of $V_a$ in $U_a\times_TT_0$ and then in $U_a$; the sheaf
equalizer shows that $s_a|_{U_a\times_TT_0}=t_0|_{U_a\times_TT_0}$. Every
nonempty closed subset of $T$ meets $T_0$ by the connectedness argument
above, so $\coprod_aU_a\to T$ is surjective.

Choose the finite surjective refinement $r:T'\to T$ of the preceding lemma
and opens $W_a\subset T'$ mapping to $U_a$. Pulling back $s_a$ gives local
sections on $W_a$. On $W_a\cap W_b$ their closed-fibre restrictions both
equal $r_0^{-1}t_0$; the already proved injectivity for the finite scheme
$T'\to T$ makes them equal. They glue to $s'\in\Gamma(T',r^{-1}E)$.
The two pullbacks of $s'$ to $T'\times_TT'$ have the same closed-fibre
restriction, and injectivity for the finite morphism
$T'\times_TT'\to T$ makes them equal.

It remains to spell out descent along $r$, which need not be etale. At a
geometric point $\bar x\to T$, choose a geometric $\bar x'\to T'$ above it.
The germ of $s'$ at $\bar x'$ is an element of the stalk $E_{\bar x}$.
The equalizer equality on $T'\times_TT'$ makes this element independent of
$\bar x'$. Represent it on an etale neighbourhood of $\bar x$ in $T$.
After shrinking, its pullback equals $s'$ near every point over $\bar x$;
finiteness of $r$ makes that inverse image quasi-compact, so one shrinking
works for all of them. These local descended sections agree on overlaps
because equality can be checked at geometric stalks, and hence glue to
$s\in\Gamma(T,E)$. Its restriction is $t_0$ by injectivity on $T_0$.
All pullbacks used are the functorial sheafification units, so the argument
also proves functoriality in $E$ and compatibility with finite pullback. The
source locators are Tags `09ZG` and `09ZF`; neither is used as
an unexpanded conclusion.
