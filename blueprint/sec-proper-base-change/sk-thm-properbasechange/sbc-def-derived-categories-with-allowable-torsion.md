Let $\mathcal P$ be a set of primes. Write

$$
D^b_{\mathcal P\text{-tor}}(T_{\Et}),\qquad
D^+_{\mathcal P\text{-tor}}(T_{\Et})
$$

for the full triangulated subcategories of the derived category of
abelian etale sheaves on $T$ consisting respectively of bounded and
bounded-below complexes $K$ such that every geometric stalk of every
$H^q(K)$ is a torsion group whose prime divisors belong to $\mathcal P$.
