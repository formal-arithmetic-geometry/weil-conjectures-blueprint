For $Z=A,B,C,D$, the product-cone limit carries the Weil structure

$$
\Theta_{Z,\infty}:
\Phi_{Y'}Z_\infty
\xrightarrow{\sim}R\varprojlim_n\Phi_{Y'}Z_n
\xrightarrow{R\varprojlim_n\Theta_{Z,n}}Z_\infty.
$$

The first arrow is the canonical comparison, which is an isomorphism because
$\Phi_{Y'}$ is an equivalence and therefore preserves the two products and
the fibre in the product-cone model. Each of $H,V,H',V'$ is Weil-equivariant.
For the common limit map $W:=V'H=H'V:A_\infty\to D_\infty$, the two typed
composites

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Phi_{Y'}A_\infty&\xrightarrow{\Theta_{A,\infty}}A_\infty
\xrightarrow{W}D_\infty,\\
\Phi_{Y'}A_\infty&\xrightarrow{\Phi_{Y'}(W)}\Phi_{Y'}D_\infty
\xrightarrow{\Theta_{D,\infty}}D_\infty
\end{aligned}
$$

are equal.

## Proof

Apply $\Phi_{Y'}$ to the product-cone triangle for each tower. Preservation
of products identifies the two product terms with the products of
$\Phi_{Y'}Z_n$, and transition compatibility identifies the two
$1-\mathrm{shift}$ arrows. Thus the displayed comparison is an isomorphism
of fibres. On its $n$th product coordinate, equivariance of $H,V,H',V'$ is
exactly one of the four finite edge equations. Hence the product maps and
their maps on fibres are equivariant. Composing the equations for $H,V'$ or
for $V,H'$ gives

$$
W\Theta_{A,\infty}
=\Theta_{D,\infty}\Phi_{Y'}(W).
$$

The equality $V'H=H'V$ is already an equality of maps of product-cone
diagrams, so both factorizations give the same typed Weil morphism.
