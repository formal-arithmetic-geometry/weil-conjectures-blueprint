Every finite morphism satisfies $\mathsf{PBC}$.

## Proof

The finite exchange lemma supplies the required isomorphism for every base
change and every torsion sheaf, which is exactly Definition
[def-weil-pbc-property]. Equivalently, the vanishing in the exactness
lemma gives $\mathsf{IA}$ and Lemma [lemma-weil-pbc-property-iff-acyclicity]
gives $\mathsf{PBC}$.

## Detailed form

Every finite morphism $f$ satisfies $\mathrm{PBC}(f)$ in the sense of
[def-weil-pbc-property].

## Proof

Finite morphisms and all their base changes are finite, so
[lemma-weil-pbc-finite-exchange] supplies the canonical exchange isomorphism for
every base change and every torsion sheaf, which is the definition of
$\mathrm{PBC}(f)$ by [def-weil-pbc-property].
