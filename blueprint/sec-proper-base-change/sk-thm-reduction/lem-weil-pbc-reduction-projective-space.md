Assume that for every scheme $S$ the projection $\mathbf P^1_S\to S$ satisfies
$\mathrm{PBC}$ in the sense of [def-weil-pbc-property]. Then, for every scheme
$T$ and every $n\geq0$, the product projection $(\mathbf P^1_T)^n\to T$
satisfies $\mathrm{PBC}$ by repeated base change and composition (over the
successive bases $T,\mathbf P^1_T,\dots$), and $\mathbf P^n_T\to T$ satisfies
$\mathrm{PBC}$ by cancellation along $\sigma_n$.
