Let $X$ be quasi-compact and quasi-separated and let $(F_\lambda)$ be a
filtered system of torsion etale sheaves. For every $q\geq0$ the canonical
map

$$
\varinjlim_\lambda H^q(X,F_\lambda)\longrightarrow
H^q(X,\varinjlim_\lambda F_\lambda)
$$

is an isomorphism, naturally in $X$, the system, and pullback along a field
extension.

## Proof

For $q=0$, choose a finite etale cover on which a section is represented.
The section and its finitely many equalizer equations on pairwise fibre
products occur at one index, proving surjectivity; if two representatives
become equal in the colimit, the finite cover and equality witnesses occur
at one later index, proving injectivity.

For $q>0$, represent a class on a split etale hypercover whose
$(q+1)$-skeleton has finitely many quasi-compact components. A cocycle uses
finitely many sections and face-map equations, so all occur at one index
$\lambda$. This proves surjectivity. If the class from $F_\lambda$ dies in
the colimit, choose a finite refinement and a degree-$(q-1)$ cochain whose
coboundary is the cocycle. The refinement maps, cochain sections, and
coboundary equations occur at one $\mu\geq\lambda$, so the class already
dies in $H^q(X,F_\mu)$. Pullback of the finite hypercover and all its face
maps gives the same construction over an extension field, which proves the
stated naturality.

Apply the filtered-colimit theorem for etale cohomology to the given
quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme $C$. For a ground-field extension,
pullback of the hypercovers, sections and cocycles in that proof gives the
maps $\rho^q_{k'/k}$ of [def-weil-pbc-eight-curve-assertions].
Pullback commutes with the sheaf colimit, and hence with the canonical
comparison maps. This proves the stated compatibility.
