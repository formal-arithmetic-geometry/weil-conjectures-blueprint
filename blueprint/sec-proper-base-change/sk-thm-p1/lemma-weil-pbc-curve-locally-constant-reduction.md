Let $U$ be irreducible and let $G$ be a finite locally constant sheaf of
$\mathbf F_\ell$-vector spaces on $U_{\Et}$. There is a connected finite
etale $v:V\to U$ of degree prime to $\ell$ such that $v^{-1}G$ has a
filtration by subsheaves with constant $\mathbf F_\ell$-quotients. The
adjunction unit and the trace satisfy

$$
 G\xrightarrow{\eta}v_*v^{-1}G
 \xrightarrow{\operatorname{tr}}G
   =\deg(v)\operatorname{id}_G,
$$

so $G$ is a direct summand of $v_*v^{-1}G$.

## Proof

Choose a geometric point $\bar u$ of $U$. The locally constant sheaf gives
a representation

$$
\rho:\pi_1(U,\bar u)\longrightarrow
\operatorname{GL}_{\mathbf F_\ell}(G_{\bar u})
$$

with finite image $Q$. If $H\subseteq Q$ is an $\ell$-Sylow subgroup, the
inverse image $\rho^{-1}(H)$ defines a connected finite etale cover
$v:V\to U$ of degree $d=[Q:H]$, which is prime to $\ell$. On $V$, the
monodromy factors through $H$.

The representation filtration gives
$0=V_0\subset V_1\subset\cdots\subset V_m=G_{\bar u}$ with
$V_a/V_{a-1}\cong\mathbf F_\ell$ and trivial $H$-action. Passing from
$H$-modules to locally constant sheaves gives, for every $a$, the explicit
short exact sequence

$$
0\longrightarrow G_{a-1}\longrightarrow G_a\longrightarrow
\underline{\mathbf F_\ell}_V\longrightarrow0,
\qquad G_m=v^{-1}G.
$$

All inclusions, quotient maps, and connecting maps commute with extension of
the algebraically closed ground field.

The adjunction unit and the fibrewise sum are

$$
\eta:G\longrightarrow v_*v^{-1}G,\qquad
\operatorname{tr}:v_*v^{-1}G\longrightarrow G.
$$

At a geometric stalk, $\eta(s)=(s,\ldots,s)$ in the direct sum indexed by
the $d$ points of the fibre, while
$\operatorname{tr}(s_1,\ldots,s_d)=\sum_as_a$. Consequently
$\operatorname{tr}\circ\eta=d\,\operatorname{id}_G$. Multiplication by
$d^{-1}\in\mathbf F_\ell$ defines
$r=d^{-1}\operatorname{tr}$ with $r\eta=\operatorname{id}_G$.
The stalk formulas are preserved by base change, so the direct-summand
decomposition and every filtration exact sequence are compatible with the
cohomology comparison maps.

Under the finite-etale correspondence of [thm-galois-lc-etale], the finite
locally constant $\mathbf F_\ell$-sheaf $G$ on the irreducible $U$
corresponds to a finite etale $U$-scheme, and its monodromy is the action of
the finite group $Q$ (the image of $\rho$) on the geometric stalk
$G_{\bar u}$. Let $H$ be a Sylow $\ell$-subgroup of $Q$, of index prime to
$\ell$, and let $v:V\to U$ be the corresponding connected finite etale map of
degree $[Q:H]$; then the monodromy of $v^{-1}G$ is the $\ell$-group $H$, so
the finite $\ell$-group filtration of
[lemma-weil-pbc-finite-l-group-filtration] applied to the $H$-module
$G_{\bar u}$ gives a filtration of $v^{-1}G$ with constant
$\mathbf F_\ell$-quotients. At a geometric point, the unit
$G\to v_*v^{-1}G$ is the diagonal and the trace is the sum over the finite
fibre, by [lemma-weil-pbc-finite-stalk-formula], so their composite is
$\deg(v)\operatorname{id}_G$ with $\deg(v)\not\equiv0\pmod\ell$, and $G$ is a
direct summand of $v_*v^{-1}G$.
