If $\mathcal F\cong\mathcal F'$ in $\shv{\et X}$, then $\mathcal F$ is
locally constant (finite, finite locally constant, constructible) if and
only if $\mathcal F'$ is.

## Proof

An isomorphism of sheaves induces isomorphisms of the restrictions to every
localised site, of all stalks, and of all pullbacks, and each of the four
notions is a condition on these. A trivialising datum, respectively a
stratification, for $\mathcal F$ is therefore one for $\mathcal F'$.
