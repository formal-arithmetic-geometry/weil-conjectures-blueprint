Let $k$ be a field. A *variety over $k$* is a scheme $X$ over $k$
which is integral and whose structure morphism $X\to\operatorname{Spec}(k)$ is
separated and of finite type
(Varieties, Definition 33.3.1, Tag
[020D](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/020D)). A
*curve over $k$* is a scheme over $k$ which is a variety of
dimension $1$ ([def-pc-dimension]; Varieties, Definition 33.43.1,
Tag [0A23](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0A23)).
*Terminology.* This is the curve notion of the Stacks
Project (integral variety of dimension one over an arbitrary base
field), and it differs from the smooth-curve convention of
the curve-calculation chapter ([def-sc-curves]: a separated
scheme of finite type of dimension at most one over an
*algebraically closed* field);
