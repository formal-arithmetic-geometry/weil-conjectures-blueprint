*Proposition (sketch).*

Let $D$ be a divisible abelian group, $\ell$ a prime and $r\ge0$ with
$\lvert D[\ell]\rvert=\ell^r$. Then $D[\ell^n]\cong(\Z/\ell^n\Z)^r$
for every $n\ge1$.

## Proof

Induction on $n$, the case $n=1$ being the hypothesis
$D[\ell]\cong(\Z/\ell\Z)^r$. Multiplication by $\ell$ gives an exact
sequence
$0\to D[\ell]\to D[\ell^{n+1}]\xrightarrow{\ell}D[\ell^n]\to0$,
surjective on the right by divisibility. So $D[\ell^{n+1}]$ is a
finite abelian $\ell$-group of order $\ell^{(n+1)r}$ with
$\ell\cdot D[\ell^{n+1}]\cong(\Z/\ell^n\Z)^r$ and
$D[\ell^{n+1}][\ell]\cong(\Z/\ell\Z)^r$. Writing
$D[\ell^{n+1}]\cong\bigoplus_i\Z/\ell^{a_i}\Z$, the second condition
says there are exactly $r$ cyclic summands and the first that exactly
$r$ of them satisfy $a_i\ge2$ with $a_i-1=n$; hence all $a_i=n+1$.
