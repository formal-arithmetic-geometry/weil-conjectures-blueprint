*Proposition (sketch).*

Let $k\subseteq k'$ be an extension of algebraically closed fields of
characteristic $p>0$, $V$ a finite-dimensional $k$-vector space and
$F:V\to V$ $p$-linear, with base change
$F'=F\otimes\sigma_{k'}$ on $V\otimes_kk'$. Then
$V^F\to(V\otimes_kk')^{F'}$, $v\mapsto v\otimes1$, is an isomorphism
of $\F_p$-vector spaces.

## Proof

Choose a $k$-basis and write $F(e_j)=\sum_ia_{ij}e_i$ with
$a_{ij}\in k$. The fixed points are the solutions in $(k')^n$ of the
system $x_i=\sum_ja_{ij}x_j^p$, whose coefficients lie in $k$. By the
block decomposition used in [sk-prop-av-lang-steinberg], the equations
express $x_i=\sum_{k\le i}a_k^{p^{\,i-k}}x_m^{p^{\,i-k+1}}$ as
polynomials in $x_m$ with coefficients in $k$, and the remaining
equation is $\varphi(x_m)=0$ for a nonzero polynomial $\varphi\in k[X]$; all its roots lie in the algebraically closed field $k$. The
two solution sets therefore agree blockwise, and the map is injective,
so it is an isomorphism.
