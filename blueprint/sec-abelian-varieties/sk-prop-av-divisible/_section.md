*Proposition (sketch).*

Let $A$ be an abelian variety over an algebraically closed field $k$
and $n\ge1$. Then $[n]:A(k)\to A(k)$ is surjective: $A(k)$ is a
divisible abelian group.

## Proof

By [sk-prop-av-isogeny], $[n]$ is finite flat and surjective; a finite
flat surjective morphism over the algebraically closed field $k$ is
surjective on $k$-points, because the fibre over $y\in A(k)$ is a
nonempty finite $k$-scheme, hence has a $k$-point.
