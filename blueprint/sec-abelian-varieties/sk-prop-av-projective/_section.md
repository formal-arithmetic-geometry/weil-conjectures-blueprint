*Proposition (sketch).*

Every abelian variety $A$ over a field $k$ is projective over $k$; in
particular $A$ carries an ample invertible $\cO_A$-module.

## Proof

$A$ is an algebraic group scheme over $k$, hence quasi-projective
(`0BF7`); it is proper by [sk-def-av], and a quasi-projective
proper scheme over a field is projective (`0B45`, applied with
$S=\Spec k$). A projective scheme carries an ample module, namely the
pullback of $\cO(1)$ under the closed immersion into projective space
([sk-def-av-ample-degree]).
