*Proposition (sketch).*

Let $G$ be a commutative group scheme over $k$ and $n\ge1$. Then the
$n$-fold sum map $[n]:G\to G$ is a homomorphism of group schemes.

## Proof

The sum map $m:G\times_kG\to G$ is a homomorphism when $G$ is
commutative (the group law of $G\times_kG$ is componentwise), so its
$n$-fold iterate $[n]$ is a composite of homomorphisms.
