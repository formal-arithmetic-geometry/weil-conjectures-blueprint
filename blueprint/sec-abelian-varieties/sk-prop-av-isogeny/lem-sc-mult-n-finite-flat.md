Let $A$ be an abelian variety of dimension $g$ over a field $k$
and let $d\geq1$. Then $[d]:A\to A$ of [def-sc-mult-n] is
finite, flat and locally free of rank $d^{2g}$, with finite kernel
$A[d]$ of order $d^{2g}$.

## Proof

The clauses are the recorded classical input of the statement.
Finiteness, flatness and local freeness of rank $d^{2g}$ with finite
kernel of order $d^{2g}$ are Stacks Project, Groupoid Schemes, Lemma
39.9.8 ([Tag 0BFG](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BFG)) and
Proposition 39.9.11 ([Tag
03RP](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03RP)); no separate
proof is given.
