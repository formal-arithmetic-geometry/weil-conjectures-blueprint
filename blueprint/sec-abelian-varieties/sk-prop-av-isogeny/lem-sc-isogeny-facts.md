Let $A$ be an abelian variety of
dimension $g$ over an algebraically closed field $k$ and
$n\geq1$.

1. **(a)** The map $[n]$ of [def-sc-mult-n] is an
isogeny of degree $n^{2g}$, finite,
flat and surjective.
1. **(b)** In particular the kernel $A[n]$ is a finite flat group
scheme of order $n^{2g}$ over $k$, and $[n]:A\to A$ is an fppf
covering.

(abelian varieties are projective; recorded in this blueprint as

recorded as [thm-sc-theorem-of-cube]; see also More on Morphisms, Theorem 37.33.8, [Tag 0BF4](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BF4)), Lemma
39.9.8, [Tag 0BFG](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BFG) ($[d]$ is finite locally free of degree
$d^{2\dim A}$, recorded as [lem-sc-mult-n-finite-flat]), and Proposition 39.9.11, [Tag 03RP](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03RP); cf. the
classical treatments of Mumford and Milne*. (a) By
[lem-sc-mult-n-isogeny], the map $[n]$ of
[def-sc-mult-n] is a surjective homomorphism of group schemes
with finite kernel $A[n]$, and it is finite (as in loc. cit.);
it is an isogeny in the sense of [def-sc-isogeny]. It is
flat: the fibres $[n]^{-1}(y)=x+A[n]$ are translates of the
finite scheme $A[n]$, hence all have the same length, so
[lem-sc-finite-constant-length-flat] applies and
$[n]_*\mathcal O_A$ is locally free of rank $\deg([n])$. Thus
$[n]$ is finite flat and surjective.

It remains to compute the degree. We follow the classical argument of [lem-sc-mult-n-finite-flat]. By
[lem-sc-abelian-variety-projective] $A$ is projective, so
it carries an ample line bundle, and for any ample $\mathcal L$
the module $\mathcal N:=\mathcal L\otimes[-1]^*\mathcal L$ is
ample with $[-1]^*\mathcal N\cong\mathcal N$
([lem-sc-ample-tensor]). By [thm-sc-theorem-of-cube]
and [lem-sc-mult-n-pullback],
$[n]^*\mathcal N\cong\mathcal N^{\otimes n^2}$. Let
$\deg_{\mathcal M}$ be the degree of [def-sc-hilbert-degree],
so that $m\mapsto\chi(A,\mathcal N^{\otimes m})$ is the numerical
polynomial of [lem-sc-hilbert-polynomial]. Then

$$
\deg_{\mathcal N^{\otimes n^2}}(A)=n^{2g}\deg_{\mathcal N}(A),
$$

because replacing $\mathcal N$ by $\mathcal N^{\otimes n^2}$
replaces $\chi(A,\mathcal N^{\otimes m})$ by
$\chi(A,\mathcal N^{\otimes mn^2})$, which multiplies the leading
coefficient of the numerical polynomial by $n^{2g}$. By
[lem-sc-deg-pullback-finite], since $[n]$ is finite
surjective,

$$
\deg_{\mathcal N^{\otimes n^2}}(A)
=\deg_{[n]^*\mathcal N}(A)=\deg([n])\deg_{\mathcal N}(A).
$$

Here $\deg([n])$ is the degree of the finite flat morphism
$[n]$, which is the order of the kernel $A[n]$, i.e. the
degree of the isogeny $[n]$, by
[lem-sc-isogeny-degree]. Comparing the two formulas gives
$\deg([n])=n^{2g}$ (using
$\deg_{\mathcal N}(A)\neq0$: for an ample $\mathcal M$ on a
proper $g$-dimensional variety over $k$, $\deg_{\mathcal M}(X)>0$, *reference: Stacks Project, Varieties, Lemma
33.45.9, [Tag 0BEV](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BEV)*). This
gives (a), and (b) is immediate from
the definition of the kernel ([def-sc-mult-n]) and the
finiteness statement.
