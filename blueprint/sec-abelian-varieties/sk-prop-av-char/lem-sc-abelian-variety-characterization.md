Let $k$ be a field and $A$ a
group scheme over $k$ which is
proper, connected and smooth over $k$ (a *complete group
variety*). Then $A$ is irreducible: it is connected and locally
irreducible (smoothness), and a connected locally irreducible scheme
is irreducible; being connected, $A$ is also its own identity
component, and the identity component of a group scheme of finite type
over a field is geometrically irreducible; being smooth (smooth
schemes over $k$ are geometrically reduced), $A$ is therefore
geometrically integral. Consequently
$A$ is a proper smooth connected group scheme: an *abelian
variety* in the sense of
[def-sc-abelian-variety] is exactly a complete group variety.
The smoothness hypothesis cannot be dropped: for
$\operatorname{char}k=p>0$ the finite group schemes

$$
\alpha_p=\Spec k[x]/(x^p),\qquad
\mu_p=\Spec k[x]/(x^p-1)
$$

are proper and connected but not reduced, hence not smooth, over
$k$.

## Proof

This is the recorded classical input of the statement, Stacks Project,
Groupoid Schemes, Definition 39.9.1
([Tag 03RO](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03RO)) with Remark
39.9.12 ([Tag 0H2U](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0H2U)),
Lemma 39.7.10 ([Tag 0B7Q](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0B7Q))
and Lemma 39.9.4 ([Tag
0BFC](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BFC)). The implication chain displayed in the statement is the standard
one: a connected locally irreducible scheme is irreducible, the identity
component of a group scheme of finite type over a field is geometrically
irreducible, and a smooth $k$-scheme is geometrically reduced, hence
geometrically integral when connected and irreducible. The blueprint uses
the equivalence as the bridge between [def-sc-abelian-variety] and
the classical notion of a complete group variety, so it is recorded here
rather than reproved.
