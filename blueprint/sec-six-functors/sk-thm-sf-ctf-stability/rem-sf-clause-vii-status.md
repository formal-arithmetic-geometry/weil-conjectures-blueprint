Pullback, tensor, and the elementary coefficient comparisons are
[lem-fix-operation-reduction]. General finite constructible
internal Hom, duality, and exceptional inverse image have the
comparisons
[thm-coef-finite-hom], [cor-coef-finite-verdier], [lem-coef-finite-exceptional].
At integral coefficients the corresponding conclusions are
[lem-coef-integral-hom-reduction], [thm-coef-integral-verdier], [prop-coef-integral-exceptional-adjoint].
Their finite scalar-extension and rational identifications are
[lem-coef-integral-finite-extension], [lem-coef-rational-operations], [thm-coef-qbar-verdier].
These comparisons preserve the specified evaluations and adjunction
maps. The coefficient-only sharp Hom bound still requires the
site-perfect hypothesis in [thm-sf-hom-ctf]; that bound is a
different assertion from coefficient comparison.

A separately supplied DVR system reconstructs with its stated
reductions once the coherent normalization condition of
[def-coef-normalized-dvr-tower] is verified, by
[lem-coef-normalized-dvr-effectivity]. Constructibility of the
result additionally requires the stated finite-level finiteness and
uniform bounds. Common lisse local models are an optional stronger
description, as [rem-sf-tower-shapes-occurring] explains.
The formal Weil lift [lem-fix-weil-operations] applies to these
proved operations; duality equivariance is
[cor-coef-verdier-weil-equivariance].
