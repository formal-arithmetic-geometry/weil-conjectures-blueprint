For an integral object of [def-weil-derived-complete-integral-detailed],
the reductions $K_n=K\otimes^L_{\mathcal O_E}A_{E,n}$ form a
coherent normalized tower, and
[lem-coef-integral-residue-tor] proves a common finite Tor
interval from the residue reduction. Conversely, a separately
supplied system satisfying
[def-coef-normalized-dvr-tower] reconstructs with exactly those
reductions by [lem-coef-normalized-dvr-effectivity].
This effectivity theorem needs no common stratification or lisse
local model. Membership in the integral constructible category
then follows from finite-level constructibility and a uniform bound.

For the direct-image tower in [def-weil-derived-direct-image],
normalization is [lem-coef-finite-direct-image], and the
finite direct-image bound of
[cor-sf-direct-image-ctf-proetale] is uniform in the coefficient
level. Thus normalized DVR effectivity supplies the canonical
finite-reduction comparison without additional local models.
The compact-support and exceptional versions are
[lem-coef-integral-compact-support], [prop-coef-integral-exceptional-adjoint].

The stronger local-model assertions
*Stage-independent local models for a constant tower*, *Stage-independent local models for a lisse tower with a uniform trivializing cover*
continue to require their displayed lisse hypotheses; the corollary
*The finite-level comparison isomorphisms in the two cases* describes those
special cases. A tower with no verified normalization or quotient
cocycle is not covered by the general effectivity theorem, and merely
forming its derived limit does not identify its purported reductions.
