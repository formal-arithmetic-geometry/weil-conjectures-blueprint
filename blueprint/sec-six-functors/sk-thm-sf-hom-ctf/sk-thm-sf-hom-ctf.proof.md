The sharper interval fails for general $K$: for
the origin $i:\{0\}\hookrightarrow\mathbf A^1$ the complexes $i_*A$ and $A$
have Tor amplitude $[0,0]$, but $\RHom_A(i_*A,A)=i_*A(-1)[-2]$.

Constructibility: every cohomology sheaf of $\RHom_A(K,M)$ is constructible,
because the $\mathcal Ext$-sheaves of two constructible complexes are
constructible on a common stratification. Dualizable case (no duality
theory is needed for it): a dualizable $K$ is perfect, and a perfect complex
with Tor amplitude in $[a,b]$ is locally a bounded complex $P$ of finite
projective $A$-modules in degrees $[a,b]$, so
$\RHom_A(K,M)=P^\vee\otimes^L_AM$ locally, $P^\vee$ being finite projective
in degrees $[-b,-a]$; tensoring with $M$ of Tor amplitude $[c,d]$ gives Tor
amplitude in $[c-b,d-a]$, and since stalks are exact and conservative on the
étale site the interval holds globally. General case: the stalk of $\RHom$ is *not*
$\RHom$ of the stalks (the example above), and one argues geometrically. No
admissibility datum on the structure morphism $a_X$ is assumed: the general
interval rests on [sk-prop-sf-biduality-general], whose dualizing complex is
formed with the unconditional constructible adjoint $Ra_X^!$ of
[sk-def-sf-operations] (vi) — [sk-prop-sf-existence] (a) gives the étale
adjoint of $Ra_{X!}$ for the compactifiable $a_X$ between Noetherian schemes,
(c) transports it to $\Dctf$, and the preservation clauses are
[sk-prop-sf-rf-shriek-preservation]. By
[sk-prop-sf-biduality-general] — applied to $a_X$, with the
unconditional $Ra_X^!$ — and the tensor–Hom adjunction,
$\RHom_A(K,M)\cong\mathbb D_X(K\otimes^L_A\mathbb D_XM)$, and $\mathbb D_X$
carries Tor amplitude $[c,d]$ into $[-d-2m,-c]$ (the dualizing complex has
cohomology in $[-2m,0]$). Applying this twice, with the additivity of Tor
amplitude for $\otimes^L$, gives $[c-b-2m,d-a+2m]$.
