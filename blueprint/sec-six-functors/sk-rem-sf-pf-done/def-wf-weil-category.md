Let $E/\mathbf Q_\ell$ be finite and let $X_0$ be a
separated scheme of finite type
over $\mathbf F_q$, with $X=X_0\otimes_{\mathbf F_q}\overline{\mathbf F}_q$.
A *Weil complex* $(K,\varphi_K)$ consists of
$K\in D^b_c(X,E)$ (the categories of
[def-weil-pbc-bounded-constructible-complete]) and an isomorphism
$\varphi_K:\Phi_X^*K\cong K$, where $\Phi_X$ is the geometric
Frobenius of [def-tw-frobenius-action]; morphisms are morphisms
of $K$ commuting with the $\varphi$'s. The *Weil category*
$\mathrm{WeilD}(X_0,E)$ has as objects the Weil complexes; its strict
version uses the same objects and all commuting morphisms. The
$\overline{\mathbf Q}_\ell$-version is the filtered colimit over the
finite subfields $E$ of its finite-stage analogue (the
$2$-colimit of
[def-weil-pbc-qbar-category]).
