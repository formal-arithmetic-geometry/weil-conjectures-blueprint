In the six-functor datum of
[def-fix-six-functor-datum], let $f:X\to Y$ be
separated of finite
type, let $K\in D^b_c(X,\Lambda)$ and
$L\in D^b_{ctf}(Y,\Lambda)$, using the
finite-Tor subcategory.
The
projection transformation, built from the
derived tensor and pullback
and the compact-support direct image of
[def-compact-support-direct-image-detailed],
is then an isomorphism at every coefficient stage:

$$
\operatorname{PF}_{f,K,L}:Rf_!K\otimes^L_{\Lambda}L
\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }Rf_!\bigl(K\otimes^L_{\Lambda}Lf^*L\bigr),
$$

natural in $K$ and $L$, compatible with the composition law of
[thm-sf-comp-composition] (associativity pentagon), with the compactification comparisons, with
finite reduction on the stated finite-Tor domains and scalar extension,
and with the identification
$Rf_!\cong Rf_*$ for proper $f$; at the rational and algebraically
closed stages the isomorphism restricts to the Weil categories of
[def-wf-tensor-product]. A projection formula for the
derived direct image is asserted
only in the proper case, where it is this same statement via
$Rf_!\cong Rf_*$.
