Fix the global finite-field datum, a prime $\ell\ne p$, the algebraic
closure $k=\Fbar$ of the finite field $k_0$ of that datum, a
separated finite-type
$k$-scheme $Y$, a finite-type $k$-scheme $X$
([def-weil-scheme-morphism-properties]), and a
separated finite-type
$k$-morphism $f:X\to Y$; the source $X$ is then a separated finite-type
$k$-scheme as well, $f$ being separated and $Y$ separated over $k$.
Cover $Y$ by finitely many affine opens
$V\subseteq Y$, and for each $V$ cover $f^{-1}(V)$ by finitely many
affine opens $U\subseteq f^{-1}(V)$; each $U\to V$ is affine of finite
type, hence exhibits $U$ as a closed subscheme of the affine space
$\mathbf A^{d_U}_V$ of [def-sbc-affine-space] for some integer
$d_U\in\mathbf Z_{\geq0}$. Put $D=\max_U d_U$. Let $A=A_{E,n}$ be a
finite coefficient stage, let $Rf_{!,n}$ be the pro-étale
compact-support direct image
attached to a
compactification of
$f$, and let

$$
Rf_n^{\times}=\nu_X^*f^{\times}R\nu_{Y,*},
$$

with $\nu_X,\nu_Y$ the comparison morphisms of
[def-weil-pbc-site-comparison-morphism], be the right adjoint of
$Rf_{!,n}$ that [thm-sf-ambient-adjoint-class] constructs on the
blueprint's coefficient class [def-sf-fullcd-used-class]. Read the
exceptional inverse image
$Rf^!$ as the restriction of $Rf_n^{\times}$ to $D^b_c(Y,A)$ and to its
finite-Tor objects, and use the
constructible intervals
$D_c^{[a,b]}$ and the
finite-Tor condition. Then:

1. for all integers $a\leq b$,
$$
L\in D_c^{[a,b]}(Y,A)\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
Rf^!L\in D_c^{[a-2D,\,b+2\dim Y+1]}(X,A);
$$
1. if $K\in D^b_{ctf}(Y,A)$ has finite Tor amplitude in $[a,b]$, then
$Rf^!K$ has finite Tor amplitude in $[a-2D,b+2\dim Y+1]$; in particular
$Rf^!$ carries $D^b_{ctf}(Y,A)$ into $D^b_{ctf}(X,A)$;
1. the two constants $2D$ and $2\dim Y+1$ depend on $f$ and $Y$
alone and not on the coefficient stage $n$, so that the two clauses hold at
every finite coefficient stage $A_{E,n}$, $n\geq1$, with the same
constants;
1. consequently $f$ satisfies clauses (2) and (3) of
[def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility] at every finite coefficient
stage, with the signed constants $c_f^-=-2D$ and $c_f^+=2\dim Y+1$ of
that definition, *without* assuming clause (1) of that definition.

## Proof

*Step 1: which functor is bounded.* By
[def-weil-exceptional-inverse-image] the functor $Rf^!$ is, on the
bounded constructible category $D^b_c(Y,A_{E,n})$, the restriction of the
ambient right adjoint $Rf_n^{\times}$ of $Rf_{!,n}$, and its restriction
to finite-Tor objects is the corresponding restriction of the same functor.
On the blueprint's coefficient class [def-sf-fullcd-used-class] that
right adjoint exists and is the explicit composite
$\nu_X^*f^{\times}R\nu_{Y,*}$ of
[thm-sf-ambient-adjoint-class](2), which also supplies its unit, its
counit and the compactification comparisons; the comparison morphisms
$\nu_X,\nu_Y$ are those of
[def-weil-pbc-site-comparison-morphism]. That the bounded constructible
and finite-Tor objects are exactly the complexes coming from the étale site
is [lem-sf-proetale-constructible-origin], and that both halves of the
ambient datum are theorems on that class is
[cor-sf-ambient-adjoint-discharge]. The bounds proved below are
therefore bounds on that explicitly constructed functor, and no clause of
[def-weil-ambient-exceptional-adjoint] is used in stating them.

*Step 2: the two bounds are the assembly of the purity chapter.* The
setting of [def-pur-conventions] is the present one: the same global
finite-field datum, the same $k=\Fbar$, the same separated finite-type
morphism $f:X\to Y$ between finite-type $k$-schemes and the same
coefficient ring $A=A_{E,n}$. [thm-pur-general-admissibility] proves
that a separated finite-type morphism satisfies the two preservation clauses
of [def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility] as soon as the
open-complement condition of [def-exc-open-complement-bound] holds for
the finitely many pairs $(W_U,\mathbf A^{d_U}_V)$ formed by the affine
charts of the statement, $W_U$ being the complement of $U$ in the affine
space $\mathbf A^{d_U}_V$ of [def-sbc-affine-space]; and
[cor-pur-general-admissibility-datum] removes that hypothesis by
[lem-exc-open-complement-known]. Indeed $\mathbf A^{d_U}_V$ is of
finite type over $k$ of dimension $d_U+\dim V\leq d_U+\dim Y$, the
complement $W_U$ is a quasi-compact open subscheme of it, and $A=A_{E,n}$
is a finite ring annihilated by the power $\varpi_E^n$ of the prime
$\ell\neq\operatorname{char}(k)$, so the pair satisfies the
open-complement condition with $c_U=2(d_U+\dim Y)$. The conclusion of
[cor-pur-general-admissibility-datum] is, in the notation of
[def-weil-constructible-intervals] and
[def-weil-finite-tor-amplitude], that $Rf^!$ carries
$D_c^{[a,b]}(Y,A)$ into $D_c^{[a-2D,b-2D+c]}(X,A)$ and finite Tor
amplitude in $[a,b]$ to finite Tor amplitude in $[a-2D,b-2D+c]$, where
$D=\max_Ud_U$ and $c=\max_U(c_U+1+2(D-d_U))$. For every chart $U$,

$$
c_U+1+2(D-d_U)=2d_U+2\dim Y+1+2D-2d_U=2D+2\dim Y+1,
$$

so the maximum is $c=2D+2\dim Y+1$, the lower end is $a-2D$, and the two
bounds become $[a-2D,b+2\dim Y+1]$: these are clauses (1) and (2) of the
statement. No clause of [def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility] is
used: [cor-pur-general-admissibility-datum] displays the ambient datum
only to record that on the coefficients it quantifies over — the bounded
constructible and finite-Tor objects, of étale origin by
[lem-sf-proetale-constructible-origin] — that datum is the theorem
[cor-sf-ambient-adjoint-discharge], whose vanishing half is the
class-restricted datum [def-sf-fullcd-class] supplied by
[thm-sf-fullcd-class] with the sharp comparison bound $M=0$ of
[prop-sf-comparison-bound-zero].

*Step 3: independence of the coefficient stage.* The charts
$U\subseteq f^{-1}(V)$, the integers $d_U$ and the number
$\dim V\leq\dim Y$ come from the presentation of the coordinate rings
$\mathcal O(U)$ over $\mathcal O(V)$, an operation on the schemes alone,
and do not depend on the coefficient ring; and the hypotheses under which
[lem-exc-open-complement-known] was applied in Step 2 are the same at
every finite stage, $A_{E,n}$ being a finite ring annihilated by the power
$\varpi_E^n$ of $\ell$. Hence both the open-complement condition with
the constants $c_U$ and the constants $D$, $c$ of
[thm-pur-general-admissibility] and
[cor-pur-general-admissibility-datum] are the same integers at every
stage, and instantiating that corollary at each $n\geq1$ gives clauses (1)
and (2) at $A_{E,n}$ with these constants and with no hypothesis; this is
clause (3). It is the stage-uniform form of the open-complement condition
recorded in [thm-pur-open-complement-unconditional].

*Step 4: reading the bounds in the definitions.* Clause (2) of
[def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility] asks for signed integers
$c_f^-,c_f^+\in\mathbf Z$ with
$Rf_n^{\times}L\in D_c^{[a+c_f^-,b+c_f^+]}(X,A)$ for every
$L\in D_c^{[a,b]}(Y,A)$, and clause (3) asks that $Rf_n^{\times}$ carry
$D^b_{ctf}(Y,A)$ into $D^b_{ctf}(X,A)$; by clauses (1) and (2) these hold
with $c_f^-=-2D$ and $c_f^+=2\dim Y+1$, and by Step 1 the functor these
two clauses bound is $Rf^!$ on the two categories they concern. Clause (1)
of the same definition is not assumed: the existence of $Rf_n^{\times}$ on
those categories, with its unit, counit and compactification comparisons, is
Step 1, that is [thm-sf-ambient-adjoint-class] read through
[def-weil-exceptional-inverse-image] and
[cor-sf-ambient-adjoint-discharge]. Finally clause (v) of
the finite-Tor preservation summary is the same two assertions at the coefficient
stage $\Lambda=A$, with the membership
$Rf^!D^b_{ctf}(Y,A)\subseteq D^b_{ctf}(X,A)$ as its conclusion and the
ambient exceptional right adjoint datum as its displayed hypothesis; by
Step 1 that hypothesis is, on that category and at that stage, the theorem
[cor-sf-ambient-adjoint-discharge], so the clause holds for every
separated finite-type morphism $f$ without it. The assertions of the
statement for the remaining coefficient stages are exactly the assertions
that this proof does not make, as the last paragraph of the statement
records.
