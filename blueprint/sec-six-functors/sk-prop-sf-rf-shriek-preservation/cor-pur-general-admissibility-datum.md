In the purity conventions of this chapter
([def-pur-conventions] fixed setting), let $f:X\to Y$ be a
separated finite-type
morphism. The
ambient exceptional right
adjoint datum of [def-weil-ambient-exceptional-adjoint] was the
hypothesis under which this corollary was formerly stated; on the bounded
constructible and finite-Tor coefficients of its two clauses it is the theorem
[cor-sf-ambient-adjoint-discharge], so it is not assumed, and the two
clauses below hold without it. Then $f$
satisfies the two preservation clauses of
[def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility]: with the affine charts
$U\subseteq f^{-1}(V)$ and the integers $d_U$ of
[thm-pur-general-admissibility], put
$D=\max_Ud_U$ and $c_U=2\,(d_U+\dim Y)$. Then $Rf^!$ carries
$D_c^{[a,b]}(Y,A)$ into $D_c^{[a-2D,b-2D+c]}(X,A)$ for
$c=\max_U\bigl(c_U+1+2(D-d_U)\bigr)$, and it carries finite Tor
amplitude in $[a,b]$ to finite Tor amplitude in $[a-2D,b-2D+c]$.

## Proof

For each chart the target $\mathbf A^{d_U}_V$ of the chartwise
presentation is of finite type over $k$ of dimension
$d_U+\dim V\leq d_U+\dim Y$. The open complement $W_U$ of $U$ in it
therefore satisfies the open-complement condition with constant
$2(d_U+\dim V)$ by [lem-exc-open-complement-known], hence also with
the larger constant $c_U=2(d_U+\dim Y)$, the condition being monotone
in its constant. The hypothesis of
[thm-pur-general-admissibility] is thus satisfied with these
constants, and its conclusion is the assertion.
