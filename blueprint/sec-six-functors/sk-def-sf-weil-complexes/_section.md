A *strict Weil complex* at $\Lambda$ on $X=X_0\times_{k_0}k$ is a pair
$(K,\varphi)$ with $K\in\Dctf(X,\Lambda)$ and an isomorphism
$\varphi:Lg_\gamma^*K\xrightarrow{\sim}K$ for the geometric-Frobenius
automorphism $g_\gamma$; with morphisms the maps of underlying complexes
commuting with the $\varphi$'s, these form a category
$D^b_{ctf,\mathrm W}(X,\Lambda)$ with a forgetful functor. This is a category
of pairs over the underlying derived category, not a triangulated (derived)
category of Weil sheaves.

Its Hom-groups are not Ext groups of Weil sheaves: a nonsplit Frobenius
extension of $\Lambda$ by $\Lambda$ (a Jordan block) gives no nonzero map
$\Lambda\to\Lambda[1]$ of pairs.
