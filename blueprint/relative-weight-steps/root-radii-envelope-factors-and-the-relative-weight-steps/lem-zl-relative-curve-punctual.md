Let $h:U_0\to Y_0$ be smooth and separated with every nonempty
geometric fiber a smooth affine curve, and let $\mathcal F$ be lisse
and punctually $\iota$-pure of weight $w$. Then every Frobenius
eigenvalue on the stalk of $R^ih_!\mathcal F$ at a closed point $y$
of degree $m$ has absolute value at most
$(q^m)^{(w+i)/2}$, i.e. the punctual weight of
$R^ih_!\mathcal F$ at $y$ is at most $w+i$.

## Proof

Compact-support base change [thm-cbc-qbar], applied to the
cartesian square formed by the fiber $U_y\to U_0$ and the point
$y\to Y_0$, identifies the stalk of $R^ih_!\mathcal F$ at a
geometric point over $y$ with
$H_c^i(U_{\bar y},\mathcal F|_{U_{\bar y}})$. The restricted sheaf has
weight $w$ relative to $q^m$ by the rescaling lemma
[lem-tw-punctual-rescaling]. After a finite extension of
$\kappa(y)$, all geometric components of the affine fiber are
defined and geometrically connected. Apply precisely the affine
curve estimate [thm-a1-affine-curve-upper] to each component.
The direct sum has the same bound, and
[lem-a1-weight-bound-constant-extension] reflects it back to
$\kappa(y)$. This obtains the displayed bound using the complete
affine-curve proof, without a middle-extension or projective-curve
purity refinement.
