Fix the finite field, coefficient field and embedding $\iota$ of
[def-weil-punctual-weights].
Let $\mathcal G$ be a
constructible
$\Qlb$-Weil sheaf on a
separated finite-type
$k_0$-scheme $Y_0$. Assume that for some $u\in\mathbf R$
it is $\iota$-mixed of weights
at most $u$. Let $v\in\mathbf R$, and suppose that at every
closed point $y$ every eigenvalue $\alpha$ of local Frobenius
on $\mathcal G_{\bar y}$ satisfies
$|\iota(\alpha)|\leq q_y^{v/2}$.
Then $\mathcal G$ is $\iota$-mixed of weights at most $v$.

## Proof

Take a finite filtration by constructible Weil subsheaves supplied
by the mixedness hypothesis in [def-weil-punctual-weights].
Write $\mathcal Q_r$ for its punctually pure quotients and $u_r$
for their weights. Remove zero quotients.

A nonzero $\mathcal Q_r$ has a nonzero stalk on some lisse stratum
of a constructible stratification
([def-weil-pbc-constructible-complexes]). The locus where the
lisse rank is nonzero contains a nonempty locally closed piece.
It contains a closed geometric point of $Y=Y_0\times_{k_0}k$:
on a nonempty affine open of that piece, take a maximal ideal;
the weak Nullstellensatz gives residue field $k$.
Its coordinates lie in a finite extension of the finite field
$k_0$, so its image $y$ in $Y_0$ is a closed point.
Thus $(\mathcal Q_r)_{\bar y}\neq0$ for some such $y$.

Taking stalks of the filtration is exact and respects local
Frobenius. Choose a basis adapted to it. The Frobenius matrix is
block triangular, so its characteristic polynomial is the product
of those on the successive quotients. Each eigenvalue on
$(\mathcal Q_r)_{\bar y}$ is therefore an eigenvalue on
$\mathcal G_{\bar y}$. Choose one; it is nonzero since Frobenius
acts invertibly. Purity and the assumed bound give

$$
q_y^{u_r/2}=|\iota(\alpha)|\leq q_y^{v/2}.
$$

Since $q_y>1$, this implies $u_r\leq v$.
The original finite filtration now has all nonzero quotient weights
at most $v$, which is precisely the required mixedness bound.
