For a cartesian square of
the proper-base-change chapter with $g=\operatorname{id}_Y$, the derived exchange
morphism of [def-weil-pbc-derived-exchange] is the identity. If
$Y''\xrightarrow{h}Y'\xrightarrow{g}Y$, then, after the canonical
associativity identifications, the derived exchange morphism for the
composite base change $g\circ h$ is

$$
Lh^*Lg^{-1}Rf_*\xrightarrow{Lh^*\operatorname{BC}_{f,g}}
Lh^*Rf'_*Lv^{-1}\xrightarrow{\operatorname{BC}_{f',h}}
Rf''_*L(v\circ v')^{-1},
$$

where $v:X'\to X$, $v':X''\to X'$ are the top morphisms of the two
squares.

## Proof

For $g=\operatorname{id}_Y$ the identity case of the pasting laws for
the derived exchange morphism,
[lem-weil-pbc-exchange-identity-pasting], gives that the exchange
morphism of [def-weil-pbc-derived-exchange] is the identity. For
two successive base changes $Y''\xrightarrow{h}Y'\xrightarrow{g}Y$,
the pasting laws of [lem-weil-pbc-exchange-identity-pasting]
applied to the two vertically pasted cartesian squares identify the
derived exchange morphism for $g\circ h$ with the composite displayed,
which is the statement.
