Let $h:Y\to X$ be a morphism of schemes and $F\in\Ab(Y_{\Et})$. Then
$R^qh_*F$ is the sheaf associated with the presheaf

$$
(U\to X)\longmapsto H^q\bigl(U\times_XY,F|_{U\times_XY}\bigr)
$$

on $X_{\Et}$; more generally for $K\in D(Y_{\Et})$ the cohomology sheaf
$R^qh_*K$ is associated with $U\mapsto H^q(U\times_XY,K|_{U\times_XY})$.

## Proof

The cohomology of
[def-weil-pbc-etale-cohomology] of the fibre products
$U\times_XY$ computes the sections of the higher direct images of
[def-weil-pbc-direct-image] on the basis of etale $U\to X$; both
the direct image and the associated sheaf have the same
sheafification, which is the statement.
