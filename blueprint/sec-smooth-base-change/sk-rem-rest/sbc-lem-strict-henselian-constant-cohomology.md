Let $(R,\mathfrak m)$ be a strictly henselian local ring, let
$X=\operatorname{Spec}R$, and let $A$ be a finite constant sheaf of
order invertible in $R$. Then

$$
H^q(X_{\Et},A)=\begin{cases}A,&q=0,\\0,&q>0,\end{cases}
$$

for the etale cohomology of [def-weil-pbc-etale-cohomology].

## Proof

A finite etale cover of $\operatorname{Spec}R$ is trivial: $R$ being
strictly henselian, every finite etale $R$-algebra is a finite product
of copies of $R$ (the Hensel property and connectedness of
$\operatorname{Spec}R$). Hence the etale site of $X$ is contractible
for finite coefficients of order invertible in $R$, and the constant
sheaf $A$ is the pullback of the constant sheaf on a point:
$H^q(X_{\Et},A)=H^q(\mathrm{pt},A)$, zero for $q>0$ and $A$ for
$q=0$ (*reference: Stacks Project, Etale Cohomology: the
cohomology of a constant sheaf on a strictly henselian local scheme*).
