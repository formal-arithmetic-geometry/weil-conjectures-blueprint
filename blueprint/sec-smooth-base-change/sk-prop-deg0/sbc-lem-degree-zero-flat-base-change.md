Consider a base-change square
where $f$ is flat and locally of finite presentation with
geometrically reduced
fibres (in particular, $f$ may be smooth). Then

$$
f^{-1}g_*\mathcal F=h_*e^{-1}\mathcal F
$$

for any sheaf $\mathcal F$ on $T_{\Et}$.

## Proof

The direct image of [def-weil-pbc-direct-image] is computed by the
equalizer description of sections along the fibres; for a flat
morphism of finite presentation with geometrically reduced fibres, the
(reduced) connected components of the fibres are the geometric points,
and they correspond under base change, so for $V\to T$ etale the
sections of both sides over $V$ are the same systems of sections on the
fibres of $V\times_TY\to V$: this identifies $f^{-1}g_*\mathcal F$ and
$h_*e^{-1}\mathcal F$ as sheaves, which is the displayed equality.
