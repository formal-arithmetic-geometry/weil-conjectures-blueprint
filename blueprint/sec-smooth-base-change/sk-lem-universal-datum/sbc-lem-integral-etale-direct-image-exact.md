Let $\pi:T'\to T$ be an
integral morphism of
schemes. Then the
direct image
$\pi_*:\Ab(T'_{\Et})\to\Ab(T_{\Et})$ is exact; consequently
$R^q\pi_*=0$ for $q>0$ and $R\pi_*=\pi_*$ on $\Dplus(T'_{\Et})$.

## Proof

This is classical, Stacks Project, Etale Cohomology, Lemma 59.43.5 ([Tag 04C2](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/04C2)): for an integral morphism the direct image of etale abelian sheaves is exact, so the higher direct images vanish and the derived direct image is the underived one on bounded-below complexes. The finite case is [lemma-weil-pbc-finite-direct-image-exact] of the proper-base-change chapter; no separate proof of the general case is given.
