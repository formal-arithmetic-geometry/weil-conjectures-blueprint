**Status.** Bypassed by the formalized route: the finite-presentation and
Noetherian descent is done in one step by
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.exists_isPullback_of_finitePresentation_of_isSeparated`
and `AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.nonempty_noetherianApproximation`, so
this stage-by-stage bookkeeping is never carried out.

Every $i\in F$ satisfies $i\leq u(F)$.

## Proof

Induct on $F$. The empty case is vacuous. At an insertion step, the
selected $d(u(F),i)$ bounds both $u(F)$ and $i$; transitivity and the
induction hypothesis prove the assertion for all old and new elements.
