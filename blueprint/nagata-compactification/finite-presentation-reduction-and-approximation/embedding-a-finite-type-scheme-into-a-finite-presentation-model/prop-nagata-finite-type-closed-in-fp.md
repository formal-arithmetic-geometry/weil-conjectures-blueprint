The constructed morphism $X^{\mathrm{fp}}\to S$ is separated and of
finite presentation, and the constructed map
$i^{\mathrm{fp}}_{X/S}\colon X\to X^{\mathrm{fp}}$ is a closed immersion
over $S$.

## Proof

A finite-type morphism over a quasi-compact base has quasi-compact source,
and separatedness makes that source quasi-separated, so the model system is
available. Its property lemma makes every term finite presentation and
every structural map $i_\alpha$ a closed immersion. At the explicitly
selected stage $\alpha^{X/S}_{\mathrm{sep}}$, separatedness follows from
[lemma-nagata-fixed-base-separated-eventually]. These are exactly the
three assertions for the named envelope.
