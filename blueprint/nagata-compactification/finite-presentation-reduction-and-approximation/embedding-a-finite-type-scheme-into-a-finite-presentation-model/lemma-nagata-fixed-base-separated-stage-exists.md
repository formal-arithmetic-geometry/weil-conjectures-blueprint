Let $X=\varprojlim_\alpha X_\alpha$ over a base $S$, where the terms are
qcqs, the transition maps are affine, and every $X_\alpha\to S$ is
quasi-compact — which is automatic when $S$ is quasi-separated. If
$X\to S$ is separated, then there is an index $\alpha_0$ such that
$X_\alpha\to S$ is separated for every $\alpha\geq\alpha_0$. No
finite-presentation hypothesis on the $X_\alpha\to S$ is needed.

## Proof

Since $X_{\alpha_1}$ is quasi-compact for one fixed index $\alpha_1$, its
image meets only finitely many affine opens $V_1,\dots,V_n$ of $S$ covering
it, and every $X_\alpha$ with $\alpha\ge\alpha_1$ maps into
$V_1\cup\dots\cup V_n$. Separatedness is local on the target, so it suffices
to treat each $V_k$ separately: it is enough that the preimage of $V_k$ in
$X_\alpha$ is a separated scheme, since $V_k$ is affine. That preimage in
$X$ is separated, because $X\to S$ is separated and $V_k$ is affine, and it
is the limit of the preimages of $V_k$ in the $X_\alpha$, a cofiltered system
of qcqs schemes with affine transition maps. So
[lemma-nagata-separated-stage-exists-absolute] applies to each of the
finitely many $k$, and a common lower bound of the resulting indices is the
required $\alpha_0$.
