Under the hypotheses of
[lemma-nagata-separate-closed-data-exists], choose its center
$C\hookrightarrow Z$. Compose it with the finite-presentation closed
immersion $Z\hookrightarrow X$, and define
$\mathsf{SepBl}_U(Z_1,Z_2)\to X$ to be the blow-up of $X$ along the
resulting center $C\hookrightarrow Z\hookrightarrow X$.
