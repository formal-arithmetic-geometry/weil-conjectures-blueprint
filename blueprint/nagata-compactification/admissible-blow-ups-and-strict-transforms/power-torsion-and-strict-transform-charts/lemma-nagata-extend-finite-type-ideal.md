The sheaf $\operatorname{Ext}_{X,W}(\mathcal J)$ is a finite type
quasi-coherent ideal on $X$, and its restriction to $W$ is
$\mathcal J$.

## Proof

The selected ideal is required to have these two properties in
[def-nagata-finite-type-ideal-extension]; the witness type is nonempty
by [lemma-nagata-finite-type-ideal-extension-exists].
