Multiplication by $a$ on $M/\Gamma_{(a)}(M)$ is injective. More generally,
no nonzero class in the quotient is killed by a power of $a$.

## Proof

If $a^n[m]=0$, then $a^nm$ belongs to the power-torsion submodule, so some
further power of $a$ kills $m$. Thus $m$ already represents zero in the
quotient.
