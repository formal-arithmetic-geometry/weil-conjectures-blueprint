Let $Z\hookrightarrow X$ be a closed immersion and let $X'\to X$ be a
blow-up. Blowing up $Z$ in the pulled-back center gives the strict transform
of $Z$ in $X'$. Strict transforms computed inside $Z$ and inside $X$ agree
under the induced closed immersion.

## Proof

By [thm-nagata-strict-transform-is-blowup], the strict transform is the
blow-up of $Z$ in the extended center ideal. On an affine chart
$X=\operatorname{Spec}(A)$ with $Z=\operatorname{Spec}(B)$, the induced
map to $Z\times_XX'$ is the quotient map
$B\otimes_AA[I/a]\twoheadrightarrow B\otimes_AA[I/a]/\Gamma_{(a)}$. The target chart of the blow-up of $Z$ is
identified with this quotient by
[prop-nagata-strict-transform-chart-iso]. It is therefore precisely
the closed immersion of the closed chart model. These identifications
commute with localization and agree on overlaps by
[prop-nagata-strict-transform-closed-fiber-product]; gluing proves
equality of the two global closed subschemes, as well as the claimed
compatibility with the induced closed immersion.
