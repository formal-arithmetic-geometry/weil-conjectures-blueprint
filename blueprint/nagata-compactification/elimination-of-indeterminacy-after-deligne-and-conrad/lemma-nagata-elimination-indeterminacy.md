The morphism $X^{\mathrm{el}}(q,U)\to X$ is $U$-admissible, and the
constructed strict-transform projection
$q^{\mathrm{el}}\colon Z^{\mathrm{el}}(q,U)\to X^{\mathrm{el}}(q,U)$ is
an open immersion.

This is exactly the formalised statement: the identification of the
restriction of $q^{\mathrm{el}}$ over $U$ with the original chosen
isomorphism $q^{-1}(U)\cong U$ is *not* asserted here, because it is
already supplied to every consumer by
[lemma-nagata-strict-transform-over-complement], which identifies the
part of any strict transform lying over the preserved open with the ordinary
base change.

## Proof

Admissibility is [lemma-nagata-admissible-blowup-comp], as recorded in
[def-nagata-elimination-indeterminacy]. For the open immersion, write
$X'=X^{\mathrm{el}}(q,U)$ and $Z'=Z^{\mathrm{el}}(q,U)$.

The quasi-domination $(W,\widetilde s)$ supplied by
[thm-nagata-conrad-elimination] pulls back along the domination
$X'\to\operatorname{Bl}_{\mathcal I}(X_1)$ of
[cor-nagata-blowup-product-common-refinement] to an open $W'\subseteq X'$
containing $U$ and a morphism $s'\colon W'\to Z_1$ extending $s$. Because
$Z_1\to X_1$ is separated, the graph $\Gamma_{s'}$ is closed in
$X'\times_{X_1}Z_1$ and $\Gamma_{s'}\cong W'$. Since
$X'\setminus V(\mathcal I\mathcal I_1)=U$, the open $U$ is
scheme-theoretically dense in $X'$, hence in $W'$.

By [lemma-nagata-strict-transform-closure-characterization], $Z'$ is the
scheme-theoretic closure in $X'\times_{X_1}Z_1$ of the part lying over
$X'\setminus V(\mathcal I\mathcal I_1)=U$, which is the graph of $s$. It is
therefore contained in the closed subscheme $\Gamma_{s'}\cong W'$. So $Z'$ is
a closed subscheme of $W'$ containing $U$ as a scheme-theoretically dense
open subscheme, whence $Z'=W'$ and $q^{\mathrm{el}}\colon Z'\to X'$ is the
open immersion $W'\subseteq X'$.
