Let $X$ be affine, let $U\subseteq X$ be a quasi-compact open, let
$p\colon Y\to X$ be quasi-affine and of finite type, and let $f\colon U\to Y$
be an $X$-morphism. There is a $U$-admissible blow-up
$\widetilde X\to X$ in which $U$ is scheme-theoretically dense, together with
a quasi-domination $(W,\widetilde f)$ of $\widetilde X$ over $Y$ extending
$f$.

## Proof

By [lemma-nagata-quasi-affine-immersion-affine-space-exists] there are
an $n$ and a quasi-compact immersion $i\colon Y\to\mathbb A^n_X$ over $X$.
Put $F=i\circ f\colon U\to\mathbb A^n_X$. By
[lemma-nagata-conrad-affine-space-extension] there is a $U$-admissible
blow-up $\widetilde X_0\to X$ carrying a quasi-domination
$(\widetilde W_0,\widetilde F_0)$ of $\widetilde X_0$ over $\mathbb A^n_X$
extending $F$.

Next make $U$ scheme-theoretically dense. By
[lemma-nagata-conrad-schematically-dense-blowup] there is a
$U$-admissible blow-up $\widetilde X\to\widetilde X_0$ in which $U$ is
scheme-theoretically dense, and by
[lemma-nagata-admissible-blowup-comp] the composite
$\widetilde X\to X$ is again a $U$-admissible blow-up. Let $\widetilde W$ be
the preimage of $\widetilde W_0$ and $\widetilde F$ the composite; the graph
$\Gamma_{\widetilde F}$ is the base change of $\Gamma_{\widetilde F_0}$ and
hence still closed in $\widetilde X\times_X\mathbb A^n_X$.

Because $i$ is an immersion there is an open subscheme
$U'\subseteq\mathbb A^n_X$ such that $i$ factors as a closed immersion
$j\colon Y\hookrightarrow U'$. Put $W=\widetilde F^{-1}(U')$. It is an open
subscheme of $\widetilde X$ containing $U$, hence scheme-theoretically dense
in $\widetilde X$ and containing $U$ as a scheme-theoretically dense open.
Moreover $\Gamma_{\widetilde F|_W} =\Gamma_{\widetilde F}\cap(\widetilde X\times_XU')$ is closed in
$\widetilde X\times_XU'$.

We claim that $\widetilde F|_W$ factors as $j\circ\widetilde f$ for a
(necessarily unique) $\widetilde f\colon W\to Y$. Indeed, the pullback of
the closed immersion $j$ along $\widetilde F|_W$ is a closed subscheme of
$W$; it contains $U$ as an open subscheme, because
$\widetilde F|_U=F=j\circ f$ factors through $Y$. Since $U$ is
scheme-theoretically dense in $W$, the only closed subscheme of $W$
containing $U$ as an open subscheme is $W$ itself, so the pullback is $W$
and the factorization exists.

Then $\widetilde f|_U=f$, and $\Gamma_{\widetilde f} =(1_{\widetilde X}\times j)^{-1}(\Gamma_{\widetilde F|_W})$ is closed in
$\widetilde X\times_XY$. Thus $(W,\widetilde f)$ is the required
quasi-domination.
