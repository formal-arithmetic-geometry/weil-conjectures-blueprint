**Status.** Bypassed by the formalized route: quasi-dominations are not
introduced in Lean. The extension statements are proved directly from
scheme-theoretic dominance and separatedness, through
`AlgebraicGeometry.ext_of_isSchemeTheoreticallyDominant_of_isSeparated`.

Let $Y\to S$ be proper and let $(U,f)$ be a quasi-domination of $X$ over
$Y$. Then $U=X$; that is, $f$ extends to an $S$-morphism $X\to Y$.

## Proof

The projection $X\times_SY\to X$ is proper, being a base change of
$Y\to S$. The graph $\Gamma_f$ is a closed subscheme of $X\times_SY$ by
hypothesis, so its image in $X$ is closed. That image is $U$, because
$\Gamma_f\to U$ is an isomorphism. Thus $U$ is a closed subset of $X$
which is also dense and open, so $U=X$. Under the resulting isomorphism
$\Gamma_f\cong X$ the second projection is the desired extension.
