Let $X$ be qcqs and let $U\subseteq X$ be a quasi-compact open. There is a
$U$-admissible blow-up $X_1\to X$ in which $U$ is scheme-theoretically
dense. If $U$ is dense in $X$ and $\widetilde X\to X$ is any $U$-admissible
blow-up, the same applies to $\widetilde X$, and the composite
$X_1\to\widetilde X\to X$ is again a $U$-admissible blow-up of $X$.

## Proof

By [lemma-nagata-qc-open-complement-ideal-exists] there is a finite
type quasi-coherent ideal $\mathcal I_0\subseteq\mathcal O_X$ with
$V(\mathcal I_0)=X\setminus U$. Its blow-up is $U$-admissible, and $U$ is
scheme-theoretically dense in it by the second assertion of
[lemma-nagata-conrad-dense-in-admissible-blowup]. Applying this to
$\widetilde X$ in place of $X$ — legitimate because the preserved open of
a $U$-admissible blow-up is again quasi-compact — and composing,
[lemma-nagata-admissible-blowup-comp] identifies the composite with a
single $U$-admissible blow-up of $X$.
