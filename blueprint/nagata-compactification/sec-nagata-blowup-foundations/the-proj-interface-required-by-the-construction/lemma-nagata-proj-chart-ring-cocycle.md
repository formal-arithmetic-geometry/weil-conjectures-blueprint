**Status.** Bypassed by the formalized route: no separate relative-Proj
primitive was formalized. The blow-up is glued from the affine Proj charts
(`AlgebraicGeometry.Proj.basicOpenIsoSpec`,
`AlgebraicGeometry.Proj.iSup_basicOpen_eq_top`) with
`AlgebraicGeometry.Scheme.Cover.RelativeGluingData`.

For positive-degree homogeneous $f,g,h$, localization induces canonical
equivalences between the restrictions of $(R_{(f)})_0$ and
$(R_{(g)})_0$ to the overlap indexed by $fg$. These equivalences are the
identity for $f=g$, are inverse under exchange of $f$ and $g$, and satisfy
the cocycle equality on the triple localization indexed by $fgh$.

## Proof

Use the canonical maps between the homogeneous localizations at $f$, $g$,
and $fg$. On a representative $x/f^m$ each map sends the fraction to its
image in the localization at $fg$; the localization relation proves
independence of representatives. The identity, inverse, and triple
cocycle equations follow because both sides are the same map into the
localization at $fgh$. These are the compatibilities used by the verified
declarations `Proj.basicOpenIsoSpec` and
`Proj.affineOpenCover`.
