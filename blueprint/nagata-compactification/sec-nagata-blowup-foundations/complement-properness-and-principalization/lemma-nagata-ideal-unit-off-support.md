If $Z=V(\mathcal I)$ and $U=X\setminus Z$, then
$\mathcal I|_U=\mathcal O_U$.

## Proof

At a point outside $V(\mathcal I)$, the stalk $\mathcal I_x$ is not
contained in the maximal ideal of $\mathcal O_{X,x}$, so it contains a unit
and equals $\mathcal O_{X,x}$. Equality of quasi-coherent ideals can be
checked on stalks.
