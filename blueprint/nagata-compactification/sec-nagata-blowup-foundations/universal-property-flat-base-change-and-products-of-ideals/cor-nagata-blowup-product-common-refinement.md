The constructed $d_{\mathcal I}$ and $d_{\mathcal J}$ are morphisms over
$X$. If both ideals restrict to the unit ideal on an open $U$, the product
blow-up and both maps restrict to the identity over $U$.

## Proof

The maps are composites over $X$ by definition. On $U$, all three ideals
are the unit ideal, so all three blow-ups are identified with $U$ by the
complement theorem. The universal maps are unique over $U$, hence become
the identity under these identifications.
