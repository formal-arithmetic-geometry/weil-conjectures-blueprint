Let $X$ be a scheme and let $\mathcal I,\mathcal J$ be quasi-coherent
ideals on $X$. If the product
$\mathcal I\mathcal J$ defines an effective Cartier divisor, then each of
$\mathcal I$ and $\mathcal J$ defines an effective Cartier divisor.

## Proof

Work on affine opens and apply
[lemma-nagata-ideal-invertible-product-factor] to the corresponding
ideals. The resulting local invertible-module structures and regular
generators are compatible under localization, so both ideal sheaves define
effective Cartier divisors.
