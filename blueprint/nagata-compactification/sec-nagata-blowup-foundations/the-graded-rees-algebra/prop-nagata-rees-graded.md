The family $n\mapsto\mathcal R_A(I)_n$ defines an
$\mathbb N$-graded-ring structure on $\mathcal R_A(I)$.

## Proof

Use [lemma-nagata-rees-piece-mul] for graded multiplication,
[lemma-nagata-rees-sum-components] for existence of the direct-sum
decomposition, and [lemma-nagata-rees-components-unique] for
uniqueness.
