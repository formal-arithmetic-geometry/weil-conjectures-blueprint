The constructed morphism $r_s$ is an isomorphism over
$\operatorname{Spec}(A_s)$.

## Proof

By [prop-nagata-rees-localization], the coefficientwise localization
of the Rees algebra is the Rees algebra of $IA_s$. On the standard open
indexed by a homogeneous generator, the induced map is the isomorphism of
degree-zero chart rings from the localization equivalence. These chart
isomorphisms agree on overlaps by the localization cocycle, and therefore
glue to an inverse to $r_s$. The degree-zero piece is $A_s$ on both sides,
so the glued inverse and $r_s$ are morphisms over $\operatorname{Spec}(A_s)$.
