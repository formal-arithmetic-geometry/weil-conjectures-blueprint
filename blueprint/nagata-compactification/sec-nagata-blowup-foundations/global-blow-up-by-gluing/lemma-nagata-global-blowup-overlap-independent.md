On the intersection of two chosen basic refinements, the two overlap
constructed maps $\omega_{ij,s}$ agree.

## Proof

Refine once more to a basic open contained in both. There the two maps are
the same composite of restriction isomorphisms, by
[lemma-nagata-affine-blowup-restrict-cocycle]. Since these refinements
cover the source overlap, equality of morphisms follows by locality on the
source.
