If a basic affine open $D(s)$ lies in $V_i\cap V_j$, define

$$
\omega_{ij,s}\colon
\mathsf B_{V_i}(\mathcal I)|_{D(s)}
\longrightarrow
\mathsf B_{V_j}(\mathcal I)|_{D(s)}
$$

as $r_{j,s}\circ r_{i,s}^{-1}$: first use the inverse of the restriction
isomorphism $r_{i,s}$ to move from the first local model to the blow-up of
the localized ideal, and then use $r_{j,s}$ to reach the second local model.
Both restriction maps have the blow-up of the same localized ideal as their
common source.
