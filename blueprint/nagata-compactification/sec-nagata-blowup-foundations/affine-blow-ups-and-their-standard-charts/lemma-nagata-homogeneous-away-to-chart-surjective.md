**Status.** Bypassed by the formalized route: the affine blow-up and its
charts are the construction `AlgebraicGeometry.AffineBlowup`, with
`AffineBlowup.chart` and
`AffineBlowup.isLocalization_away_map` supplying the chart algebra
and its localization coherence, so neither is rebuilt by hand.

The constructed map $\theta_a$ is surjective.

## Proof

A normal-form element $x/a^n$ is the image of
$(xt^n)/(at)^n$.
