If $i\colon Z\hookrightarrow Y$ is a closed immersion, then the factor map
$i^{\mathrm{im}}\colon Z\to\operatorname{SIm}(i)$ is an isomorphism. Thus
the scheme-theoretic image of a closed immersion is canonically its source,
compatibly with the maps to $Y$.

## Proof

The current Mathlib instance
`AlgebraicGeometry.IsClosedImmersion.instIsIsoSchemeToImage`
supplies the isomorphism for every morphism carrying the
`IsClosedImmersion` property. Its compatibility with the inclusion
is the factorization equality
`Scheme.Hom.toImage_imageι`.
