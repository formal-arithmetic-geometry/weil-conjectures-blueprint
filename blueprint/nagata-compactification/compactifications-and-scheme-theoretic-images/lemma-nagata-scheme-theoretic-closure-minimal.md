The scheme-theoretic closure is the smallest closed subscheme of $Y$
through which $a$ factors: it factors through every such closed subscheme,
and the comparison is unique over $Y$.

## Proof

This is [lemma-nagata-scheme-image-universal] applied to the immersion
$a$, together with
[def-nagata-scheme-theoretic-closure].
