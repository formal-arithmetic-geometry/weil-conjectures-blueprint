Let $h\colon T\to P$ be quasi-compact, assume its image
inclusion $\operatorname{SIm}(h)\hookrightarrow P$ is an isomorphism, assume
$P$ is affine, and let $z\in P$. There
exist a valuation ring $A'$ with fraction field $K'$, a morphism
$\eta\colon\operatorname{Spec}(K')\to T$, and a morphism
$\alpha\colon\operatorname{Spec}(A')\to P$ such that the generic square
commutes and the closed point of $\operatorname{Spec}(A')$ maps to $z$.

## Proof

Let $Z=\operatorname{SIm}(h)$. The assumed image isomorphism identifies
$z$ with a point of $Z$. Stacks Project, Tag 02JQ (Lemma 29.6.5),
applied to the quasi-compact morphism $h$ and the point $z\in Z$, supplies
a valuation ring $A'$, its fraction field $K'$, a map
$\operatorname{Spec}(K')\to T$, and a map
$\operatorname{Spec}(A')\to Z$ whose generic restriction is the supplied
map and whose closed point is $z$. Composing the latter map with the image
closed immersion $Z\hookrightarrow P$ gives $\alpha$, and the generic
commutativity supplied by the theorem is exactly the displayed square.
