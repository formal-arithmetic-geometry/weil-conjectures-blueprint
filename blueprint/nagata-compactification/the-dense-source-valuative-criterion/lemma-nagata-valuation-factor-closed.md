Let $A$ be a valuation ring with fraction field $K$, let $Z\hookrightarrow Y$
be a closed immersion, and let $g\colon\operatorname{Spec}(A)\to Y$. If the
restriction of $g$ to $\operatorname{Spec}(K)$ factors through $Z$, then
$g$ factors through $Z$.

## Proof

Pull the defining ideal of $Z$ back to $A$. It becomes zero after applying
the injective map $A\hookrightarrow K$, so it was already zero in $A$.
