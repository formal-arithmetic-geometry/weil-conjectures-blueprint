The maps in $\mathsf{VP}(h,z)$ form a commutative diagram

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
\operatorname{Spec}(K'_{h,z})&\xrightarrow{\eta_{h,z}}&T\\
\big\downarrow&&\big\downarrow h\\
\operatorname{Spec}(A'_{h,z})&\xrightarrow{\alpha_{h,z}}&P,
\end{array}
$$

and the closed point of $\operatorname{Spec}(A'_{h,z})$ maps to $z$.

## Proof

These are exactly the fields of the witness selected in
[def-nagata-dense-valuation-probe]; nonemptiness is
[lemma-nagata-dense-valuation-probe-exists].
