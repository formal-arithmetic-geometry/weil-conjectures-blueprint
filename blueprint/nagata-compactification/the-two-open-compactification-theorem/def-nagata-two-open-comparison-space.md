Define

$$
V_{12}=V_1\times_UV_2.
$$

The separatedness of $U\to S$ gives a closed immersion
$V_{12}\to V_1\times_SV_2$, hence an immersion
$V_{12}\to X_1\times_SX_2$. Define

$$
X_{12}=\operatorname{SIm}
\bigl(V_{12}\longrightarrow X_1\times_SX_2\bigr)
$$

and let $p_i\colon X_{12}\to X_i$ be the restrictions of the two product
projections.
