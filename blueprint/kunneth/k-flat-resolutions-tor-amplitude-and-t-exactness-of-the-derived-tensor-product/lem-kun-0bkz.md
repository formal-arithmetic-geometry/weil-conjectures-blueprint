Let $X$ be a scheme, $K\in D(X_{\Et})$, and $\mathcal B$ a class
of objects of $X_{\Et}$ such that (1) every object of $X_{\Et}$
admits a covering by objects of $\mathcal B$, and (2)
$H^p(U_{\Et},\mathcal H^q(K))=0$ for all $p>0$, all
$q\in\mathbf Z$, and all $U\in\mathcal B$. Then
$H^q(U_{\Et},K)=H^0(U_{\Et},\mathcal H^q(K))$ for all $q$ and all
$U\in\mathcal B$. (*Source:* Stacks Project,

## Proof

For $U\in\mathcal B$ the hypercohomology spectral sequence of
[def-weil-pbc-hypercohomology-filtrations-detailed] (in the global-section
form) has
$E_2^{p,q}=H^p(U_{\Et},\mathcal H^q(K))\Rightarrow H^{p+q}(U_{\Et},K)$. Hypothesis (2) kills the columns $p>0$, so
only the column $p=0$ survives and there are no differentials to or
from it; hence $H^n(U_{\Et},K)=E_2^{0,n}=H^0(U_{\Et},\mathcal H^n(K))$
for every $n$, which is the assertion, in the notation of
[def-weil-pbc-etale-cohomology].
