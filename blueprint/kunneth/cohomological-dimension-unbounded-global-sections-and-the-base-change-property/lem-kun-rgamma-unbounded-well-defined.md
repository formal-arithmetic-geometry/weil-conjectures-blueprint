Let $T$ be a scheme, $\Lambda$ a commutative ring and
$K\in D(T_{\Et},\Lambda)$, and let $K\to I$ and $K\to J$ be two
K-injective
resolutions of $K$. Then any comparison $I\to J$ over $K$
induces an isomorphism $\Gamma(T_{\Et},I)\to\Gamma(T_{\Et},J)$ in
$D(\Lambda)$; consequently $\RGamma(T_{\Et},K)$ of
[def-kun-rgamma-unbounded] is independent, up to canonical
isomorphism, of the chosen K-injective resolution.

## Proof

Two K-injective resolutions of $K$ are chain-homotopy equivalent, and
a bounded-below complex of injective objects is K-injective, by
[prop-weil-pbc-kinjective-resolutions-exist]; a comparison
$I\to J$ over $K$ between K-injective resolutions in the sense of
[def-weil-pbc-kinjective-resolutions] is therefore a homotopy
equivalence. The functor $\Gamma(T_{\Et},-)$
carries chain-homotopy equivalences to homotopy equivalences of
complexes of $\Lambda$-modules, hence to isomorphisms in the derived
category, so $\Gamma(T_{\Et},I)$ is independent of the chosen
K-injective resolution $I$ of $K$, i.e. the object
$\RGamma(T_{\Et},K)$ of [def-kun-rgamma-unbounded] is well
defined.
