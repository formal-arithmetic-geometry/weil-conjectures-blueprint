Fix the global finite-field datum
and the coefficient
conventions, $A=A_{E,n}$, and let $f:X\to Y$ be a
separated finite-type
morphism of finite-type $k$-schemes. Say that $f$ is
*exceptionally admissible at $A$* when the compact-support direct image
$Rf_!:D^b_{ctf}(X,A)\to D^b_{ctf}(Y,A)$ has a specified right adjoint
$Rf^!:D^b_{ctf}(Y,A)\to D^b_{ctf}(X,A)$, with unit
$\operatorname{id}\to Rf^!Rf_!$ and counit
$Rf_!Rf^!\to\operatorname{id}$ (i.e. the adjunction $Rf_!\dashv Rf^!$),
and the composition and base-change exchange isomorphisms used below; and
*exceptionally admissible* when this holds for every finite coefficient ring
$A=A_{E,n}$ with constants independent of $n$. The functor in question is
the constructible exceptional inverse image of
[def-weil-exceptional-inverse-image].

The condition is a *theorem*, not a restriction: every separated finite-type
morphism of finite-type $k$-schemes is exceptionally admissible, the
adjunction on $D^b_{ctf}$, the preservation
$Rf^!D^b_{ctf}(Y,A)\subseteq D^b_{ctf}(X,A)$ with stage-independent constants,
and the composition and base-change isomorphisms (the mates of those of
$Rf_!$) all holding for the constructible exceptional inverse image. Nothing
of the strong ambient notion of [def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility]
— the ambient datum $\operatorname{FullCD}$ on every pro-etale sheaf together
with an ambient right adjoint — is assumed: that datum fails in general (for
an elliptic curve over $\overline{\mathbf F}_p$ with $A=\mathbf F_r$).
