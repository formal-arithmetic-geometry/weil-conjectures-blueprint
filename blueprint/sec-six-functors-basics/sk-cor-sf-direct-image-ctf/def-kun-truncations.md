For a complex $\mathcal E^\bullet$ of etale sheaves, the
*stupid truncations* $\sigma_{\ge n}$ and $\sigma_{\le n}$
are obtained by replacing the terms in degrees $<n$ (resp. $>n$)
by $0$. The *good (canonical) truncations* $\tau_{\ge n}$,
$\tau_{\le n}$ are the truncation functors of the standard
t-structure on $D(T_{\Et})$: they keep the cohomology objects in the
retained range and kill those outside it. The triangle

$$
\tau_{\le n-1}K\to\tau_{\le n}K\to\mathcal H^n(K)[-n]\to
$$

is the truncation couple of [def-sp-truncation-couple].

In a triangulated category with countable direct sums, the
*homotopy colimit* of a sequence $E_0\to E_1\to\cdots$ is
specified by a distinguished triangle

$$
\bigoplus_nE_n\xrightarrow{\,1-\mathrm{shift}\,}\bigoplus_nE_n
\longrightarrow\operatorname{hocolim}_nE_n\longrightarrow
\bigl(\bigoplus_nE_n\bigr)[1].
$$

The colimit of etale sheaves is the sheafification of the objectwise
colimit of the underlying presheaves. Geometric stalks are computed
by filtered colimits of sections over
pointed etale
neighbourhoods.
