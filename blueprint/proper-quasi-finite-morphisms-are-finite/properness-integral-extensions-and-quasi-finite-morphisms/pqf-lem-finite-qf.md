A finite morphism of schemes is quasi-finite [pqf-def-quasifinite].

## Proof

A finite morphism is affine and $f_*\mathcal O_X$ is a finite
$\mathcal O_S$-algebra, so $f$ is of finite type and quasi-compact, by the
scheme conventions. Its fibres are finite: the fibre at $s$ is
$\operatorname{Spec}$ of a finite $\kappa(s)$-algebra, which is a
finite-dimensional $\kappa(s)$-vector space, hence Artinian and therefore
has finitely many prime ideals (classical algebra). A morphism of finite
type with finite fibres is quasi-finite, by [pqf-lem-qf-finitefibres], if
it is locally of finite type; and it is, because finite type implies
locally of finite type in the sense of [pqf-def-quasifinite].
