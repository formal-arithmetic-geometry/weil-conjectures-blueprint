Let $X$ be a locally Noetherian [pqf-def-locnoeth] scheme and $\mathcal F$
an $\mathcal O_X$-module. Then $\mathcal F$ is coherent if and only if it
is quasi-coherent of finite type.

*Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 30.9.1, [Tag
01XZ](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01XZ).*

## Proof

*($\Leftarrow$).* Let $\mathcal F$ be quasi-coherent and of finite type on
the locally Noetherian $X$ [pqf-def-locnoeth] and let
$\varphi:\mathcal O_U^{\oplus n}\to\mathcal F|_U$ be a map over an open
$U$. Kernels of maps of quasi-coherent sheaves are quasi-coherent (checked
on affine open subschemes, where they correspond to kernels of maps of
modules), so $\ker\varphi$ is quasi-coherent; being a quasi-coherent
submodule of a finite-rank free module over each affine Noetherian
$\operatorname{Spec}A\subset U$ it is the sheaf $\widetilde K$ of a
submodule $K\subset A^n$, and $K$ is finitely generated because $A$ and
hence $A^n$ are Noetherian. Thus $\ker\varphi$ is of finite type, which
with $\mathcal F$ of finite type is the definition of coherence in
[pqf-def-coherent].

*($\Rightarrow$).* Let $\mathcal F$ be coherent; it is of finite type by
definition, and it is quasi-coherent: for an affine open
$\operatorname{Spec}A\subset X$ with $A$ Noetherian, the coherence
condition (finite kernels) gives that
$\mathcal F|_{\operatorname{Spec}A}$ is the sheaf associated with its
module of global sections — the classical finite-relation argument over
Noetherian rings: because $\mathcal F$ is of finite type there is a
surjection $A^n\to\Gamma(\operatorname{Spec}A,\mathcal F)$ whose kernel is
finitely generated, the kernel being of finite type by coherence, so a
presentation exists; the same argument on principal open subschemes $D(g)$
and the exactness of $(-)\otimes_A A_g$ yield
$\Gamma(D(g),\mathcal F)=\Gamma(\operatorname{Spec}A,\mathcal F)_g$, i.e.
the sheaf $\mathcal F|_{\operatorname{Spec}A}$ is
$\widetilde{\Gamma(\operatorname{Spec}A,\mathcal F)}$ (cf. the classical
equivalent characterization of coherent modules on Noetherian schemes,
Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 30.9.1, [Tag
01XZ](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01XZ)). Since this holds on
every affine open, $\mathcal F$ is quasi-coherent.
