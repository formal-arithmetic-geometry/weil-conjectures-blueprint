Let $f:X\to Y$ be a proper morphism of schemes and $y\in Y$. Assume that
$Y$ is locally Noetherian and that $f^{-1}(\{y\})$ is finite. Then for any
coherent sheaf $\mathcal F$ on $X$ we have $(R^pf_*\mathcal F)_y=0$ for all
$p>0$.

*Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Lemma 30.20.8, [Tag
02OE](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02OE), whose proof uses the
theorem on formal functions, Theorem 30.20.5, [Tag
02OC](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02OC).*

## Proof

The theorem on formal functions (recorded classical input cited in the
statement): with $\widehat{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}$ the completion of the local
ring, with the $n$-th infinitesimal neighbourhoods
$$
 X_n:=X\times_Y\operatorname{Spec}\bigl(\mathcal O_{Y,y}/\mathfrak m_y^n\bigr)
$$
of the fibre $X_y:=f^{-1}(\{y\})$, and with $\widehat X$ the *formal
completion* of $X$ along the closed fibre $X_y$ (the formal scheme
$X^{\wedge}_{X_y}$, with $\mathrm H^p(-,-)$ the cohomology functors of
[pqf-def-cohomology]), the canonical comparisons are
$$
 (R^pf_*\mathcal F)_y\otimes_{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}\widehat{\mathcal
 O_{Y,y}}\ \cong\ \mathrm H^p\bigl(\widehat X,\widehat{\mathcal F}\bigr)
 \ \cong\ \varprojlim_n\mathrm H^p(X_n,\mathcal F_n)\qquad(p\ge0),
$$
$\widehat{\mathcal F}$ being the pullback of $\mathcal F$ to the formal
completion and $\mathcal F_n$ its restriction to the thickenings, the
second comparison being the defining property of the cohomology of formal
coherent sheaves. (The *scheme*
$X\times_Y\operatorname{Spec}\widehat{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}$, whose underlying
topological space can also contain points over the generic points of the
completed local base, is not a formal completion, and its cohomology is not
the limit of the cohomologies of the $X_n$; it is $\widehat X$ that the
theorem on formal functions uses.)

The underlying topological space of the formal completion $\widehat X$,
equivalently of each $X_n$, is that of the fibre $X_y$: $f^{-1}(\{y\})$; it
is finite, zero-dimensional, and hence discrete. Each $X_n$ is therefore a
finite scheme (a disjoint union of spectra of local Artinian rings), and a
coherent sheaf on a finite discrete space has vanishing cohomology in
positive degrees (on a discrete space every sheaf is flasque, and flasque
sheaves are acyclic for $\Gamma$, as in the Leray proof of
[pqf-lem-leray]); hence $\mathrm H^p(X_n,\mathcal F_n)=0$ for every $p>0$
and every $n$, and the displayed limit gives
$\mathrm H^p(\widehat X,\widehat{\mathcal F})=0$ for every $p>0$; hence
$(R^pf_*\mathcal F)_y\otimes_{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}\widehat{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}=0$
for $p>0$.

Finally, $(R^pf_*\mathcal F)_y$ is a finitely generated
$\mathcal O_{Y,y}$-module: for a proper morphism with a locally Noetherian
target and a coherent $\mathcal F$ on the source
[pqf-def-locnoeth], [pqf-def-coherent], the higher direct images
$R^pf_*\mathcal F$ are coherent (classical: the coherence of higher direct
images for proper morphisms, cf. Stacks Cohomology of Schemes, Proposition
30.19.1, [Tag 02O5](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02O5)), and the
stalk of a coherent sheaf is finitely generated. A finitely generated
module $M$ over the Noetherian local ring $\mathcal O_{Y,y}$ with
$M\otimes_{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}\widehat{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}=0$ is zero:
following Nakayama, the completion of a finitely generated module is
$M\otimes_{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}\widehat{\mathcal O_{Y,y}}$, so the quotients
$M/\mathfrak m_y^nM$ all vanish, and with $M/\mathfrak m_yM=0$ Nakayama's
lemma gives $M=0$. Thus $(R^pf_*\mathcal F)_y=0$ for all $p>0$.
