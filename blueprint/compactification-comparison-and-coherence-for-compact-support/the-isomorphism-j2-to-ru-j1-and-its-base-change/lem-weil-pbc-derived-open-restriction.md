Let $f:T\to S$ be a scheme morphism and $a:U\hookrightarrow S$ an open
immersion. In the cartesian square put $V=T\times_SU$, $b:V\hookrightarrow T$,
and $f_U:V\to U$. For a finite ring $\Lambda$ and
$L\in D^+(T_{\Et},\Lambda)$, restriction gives a natural isomorphism
$$
 a^{-1}Rf_*L \xrightarrow{\sim} Rf_{U,*}b^{-1}L,
$$
using the derived direct image and inverse image functors.

## Proof

For an etale $W\to U$, also viewed as etale over $S$, the direct image
satisfies
$$
 (a^{-1}f_*F)(W)=F(T\times_SW)
                 =(f_{U,*}b^{-1}F)(W).
$$
Here restriction along an open is the inverse image, which is exact. The
extension-by-zero functor $b_!$ is exact and left adjoint to $b^{-1}$.
Consequently, if $I$ is injective on $T_{\Et}$, the identity
$$
 \operatorname{Hom}_{V_{\Et}}(-,b^{-1}I)
   \simeq \operatorname{Hom}_{T_{\Et}}(b_!(-),I)
$$
is an exact contravariant functor: $b_!$ preserves short exact sequences, and
$\operatorname{Hom}(-,I)$ is exact. Thus $b^{-1}I$ is injective.

Choose a bounded-below injective resolution $L\to I^\bullet$. Exactness of
$b^{-1}$ and the preceding injectivity calculation make $b^{-1}I^\bullet$ an
injective resolution of $b^{-1}L$. The displayed identity of sections applied
in every degree identifies $a^{-1}f_*I^\bullet$ with $f_{U,*}b^{-1}I^\bullet$.
Since $a^{-1}$ is exact, these represent the two derived functors in the
statement. This proves the derived isomorphism. These identifications are
restrictions of the same sections, so they commute with successive
restrictions and composition of direct images.
