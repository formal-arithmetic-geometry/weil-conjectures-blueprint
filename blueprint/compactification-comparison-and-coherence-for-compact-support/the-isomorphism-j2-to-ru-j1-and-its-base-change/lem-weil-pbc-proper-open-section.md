Let $u:T_1\to T_2$ be proper and let $j_i:X\hookrightarrow T_i$ be open
immersions with $uj_1=j_2$. For $V=T_1\times_{T_2}X$, with projections
$b:V\to T_1$, $p:V\to X$ and the morphism $s:X\to V$ induced by $j_1$ of
[def-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison], the morphism $s$ is an open immersion
with $p\circ s=\operatorname{id}_X$ whose image is open and closed in $V$, and
$s$ identifies $X$ with the open subscheme $j_1(X)$ of $V$, the projection $b$
identifying $V$ with the open subscheme $u^{-1}(j_2(X))$ of $T_1$.

## Proof

The projection $b:V\to T_1$ is the base change of the open immersion
$j_2$ along $u$; a base change of an open immersion is an open immersion, and
its image is $u^{-1}(j_2(X))$, so $b$ identifies $V$ with the open subscheme
$u^{-1}(j_2(X))$ of $T_1$. Since $uj_1=j_2$, the morphism $j_1$ maps $X$ into
$u^{-1}(j_2(X))=b(V)$, so the pair $(j_1,\operatorname{id}_X)$ factors through
the fibre product $V=T_1\times_{T_2}X$: there is a morphism $s:X\to V$ with
$bs=j_1$ and $ps=\operatorname{id}_X$, the one named in
[def-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison]. Being the restriction of the open
immersion $j_1$ to the open subscheme $b(V)$, the morphism $s$ is an open
immersion, and it identifies $X$ with the open subscheme $j_1(X)$ of $V$. By
[lem-weil-pbc-proper-open-p-proper] the morphism $p$ is proper, hence
separated, and $s$ is an open immersion with $ps=\operatorname{id}_X$; the
criterion of [lem-weil-pbc-open-section-clopen] therefore makes the image of
$s$ open and closed in $V$, with $V=s(X)\amalg(V\setminus s(X))$ a
decomposition into open subschemes.
