*Corollary (sketch).*

For a constructible Weil complex $K$ on $\Aone$, every $n\ge1$ and every
$y\in\mathbf F_{q^n}$,

$$
t_{\FT_{\psi^{-1}}\FT_\psi(K)}(y)=q^n\,t_K(y),
$$

which is the trace function of the Tate twist $K(-1)$ at points of degree
$n$.

## Proof

Apply P8 twice, with $\psi$ and then with $\psi^{-1}$; orthogonality
[sk-lem-orthogonality] in the form
$\sum_y\psi_n((x-x')y)=q^n\delta_{x,x'}$ returns $q^nt_K(x)$. The Tate twist
$K(-1)$ has trace function $q^nt_K$ at degree-$n$ points by the
normalization built into the twist def:wf-tate-twist.
