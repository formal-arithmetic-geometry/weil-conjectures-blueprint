The morphism $\pi:Y\to X_0$, $\operatorname{Spec}\mathcal O[T]/(T^p-T-f)\to X_0$, is finite etale of degree $p$; the translations $\sigma_a:T\mapsto T+a$ ($a\in\mathbf F_p$) are automorphisms of $Y$ over $X_0$ acting simply transitively on every geometric fibre, so they make $Y$ an $\mathbf F_p$-torsor over $X_0$. The resulting map $\mathbf F_p\to\mathrm{Aut}(Y/X_0)$ is injective, the automorphisms of $Y$ as an $\mathbf F_p$-torsor (those commuting with the $\sigma_a$) are $\Gamma(X_0,\mathbf F_p)$, and $\mathbf F_p\to\mathrm{Aut}(Y/X_0)$ is an isomorphism when $Y$ is connected. It is not an isomorphism in general: for $f=0$ the cover $Y\cong\coprod_{a\in\mathbf F_p}X_0$ is split, and for $p=3$, $X_0=\operatorname{Spec}\mathbf F_3$ the full automorphism group of $Y$ over $X_0$ is $S_3$.

## Proof

The ring $B=\mathcal O_{X_0}[T]/(T^p-T-f)$ is the covering ring of the
Artin–Schreier sheaf construction [def-fd-artin-schreier-sheaf]:
it is a free $\mathcal O_{X_0}$-module with basis $1,T,\ldots,T^{p-1}$, so $\pi$ is finite of degree $p$; it is etale because the formal derivative of $T^p-T-f$ is $-1$, a unit of $B$, so $B$ is *standard etale* over $\mathcal O_{X_0}$ in the sense of [def-weil-pbc-etale-site]. For $a\in\mathbf F_p$ the map $T\mapsto T+a$ is well defined because $(T+a)^p-(T+a)-f=T^p-T-f+a^p-a=T^p-T-f$; it is an automorphism with inverse $T\mapsto T-a$, and $a\mapsto\sigma_a$ is a homomorphism $\mathbf F_p\to\mathrm{Aut}(Y/X_0)$. At a geometric point $\bar x$ of $X_0$ the fibre is the set of roots of $T^p-T-f(\bar x)$ in an algebraically closed field; two such roots differ by a root of $X^p-X=\prod_{a\in\mathbf F_p}(X-a)$, i.e. by an element of $\mathbf F_p$, and the $p$ roots are distinct, so the translations act simply transitively on the fibre: $Y$ is an $\mathbf F_p$-torsor over $X_0$, and the action is faithful. For the automorphism group: an $\mathcal O_{X_0}$-algebra endomorphism of $B$ sends $T$ to another root $T'$ of $T^p-T-f$ in $B$, and $e=T'-T$ satisfies $e^p=e$, i.e. $e$ is a morphism $Y\to\operatorname{Spec}\mathbf F_p[X]/(X^p-X)=\coprod_{a\in\mathbf F_p}\operatorname{Spec}\mathbf F_p$, a locally constant function $e:Y\to\mathbf F_p$; so the endomorphism is $T\mapsto T+e$, acting as $\sigma_a$ on the components where $e=a$. It commutes with the $\sigma_a$ exactly when $e$ is $\mathbf F_p$-invariant, i.e. descends to $\Gamma(X_0,\mathbf F_p)$; and when $Y$ is connected, $e$ is a constant $a\in\mathbf F_p$, so every endomorphism is a translation and $\mathrm{Aut}(Y/X_0)\cong\mathbf F_p$. (When $Y$ is disconnected the constants do not exhaust the roots of $X^p-X$ in $B$, which is why the split case has more automorphisms.)
