Let $K$ be a $C_1$ field [def-sc-cr-field]. Then $\operatorname{Br}(K)=0$.

## Proof

We use the elementary structure theory of central simple algebras: a finite
central division algebra $D/K$ has dimension $d^2$, and over a separable
closure $K_s$ it becomes $M_d(K_s)$. The algebraic inputs are the splitting
and Wedderburn theorems ([Stacks Project, Tag
03R2](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03R2)) and the fact that
automorphisms of a matrix algebra are inner ([Stacks Project, Tag
074P](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/074P)). Choose a $K$-basis
$b_1,\ldots,b_{d^2}$ and a splitting
$\phi:D\otimes_KK_s\simeq M_d(K_s)$. Form the polynomial
$$
 P(T_1,\ldots,T_{d^2})=
 \det\left(\sum_i T_i\phi(b_i)\right).
$$
It is homogeneous of degree $d$. Changing the splitting conjugates the
matrix, leaving its determinant unchanged. For every
$\sigma\in\operatorname{Gal}(K_s/K)$, applying $\sigma$ to the splitting
gives another splitting, so every coefficient of $P$ is fixed by $\sigma$.
Hence $P\in K[T_1,\ldots,T_{d^2}]$. This defines the reduced norm; it is
distinct from the determinant of left multiplication on the
$d^2$-dimensional space $D$. For any nonzero $x\in D$, its inverse in $D$
remains an inverse after applying $\phi$, so $P(x)\ne0$. If $d>1$, then
$d^2>d$, and [def-sc-cr-field] supplies a nonzero zero of $P$, a
contradiction. Therefore every central division algebra has $d=1$ and
equals $K$. Wedderburn's theorem now shows that every central simple
algebra is a matrix algebra over $K$, so the Brauer group is zero.
