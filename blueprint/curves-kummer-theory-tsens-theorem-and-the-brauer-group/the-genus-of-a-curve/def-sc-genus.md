Let $C$ be a proper smooth curve [def-sc-curves] over an algebraically
closed field $k$. The *genus* of $C$ is
$$
 g(C):=\dim_kH^1(C,\mathcal O_C),
$$
finite because coherent cohomology of a proper scheme over a field is
finite-dimensional (coherent higher direct images of a proper morphism are
coherent: *reference: Stacks Project, Cohomology of Schemes, Proposition
30.19.1, [Tag 02O5](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02O5)*; this is
the genus of Stacks Project, Algebraic Curves, Definition 53.8.1, [Tag
0BY7](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BY7), which defines
$g=\dim_kH^1(X,\mathcal O_X)$ for a proper scheme $X$ of dimension one with
$H^0(X,\mathcal O_X)=k$, the present $C$). Equivalently, by duality
$g=\dim_kH^0(C,\Omega^1_{C/k})$ (*reference: Stacks Project, Algebraic
Curves, Lemma 53.4.1, [Tag 0BS2](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BS2),
parts (5) and (6)*).

For a smooth separated, not necessarily proper, curve the genus used in
this blueprint is the genus of a compactification $\overline C$ of $C$,
i.e. of a proper smooth curve containing $C$ as an open subscheme with
finite complement; this convention is fixed explicitly at the single place
where it is used, and it is the compactification lemma that provides the
compactification.
