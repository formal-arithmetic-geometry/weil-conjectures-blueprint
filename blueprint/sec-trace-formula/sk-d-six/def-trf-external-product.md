Use the finite coefficient ring $A=A_{E,n}$. For finite-type $k$-schemes $X_1,X_2$, projections
$p_i:X_1\times_kX_2\to X_i$, and complexes
$M_i$ in the finite-Tor constructible category $D^b_{ctf}(X_i,A)$, define

$$
M_1\boxtimes_A^L M_2:=Lp_1^*M_1\otimes_A^L Lp_2^*M_2.
$$

This notation includes the order of the factors and uses only the derived
pullback and tensor of [def-weil-derived-pullback-tensor-hom] and
[def-weil-derived-tensor].
