*Corollary (sketch).*

Let $s$ be the spectrum of a field, $X$ proper over $s$, $K\in D^b_{ctf}(X,A)$,
and let $(C,c,u)$ be an endocorrespondence on $(X,K)$ with proper ordinary leg
$c_2$ and with $\Fix(c)$ proper over $s$. Assume that $R\Gamma_c(X,K)$ is
perfect (dualizable). Then its global operator on compact cohomology satisfies

$$
\hyperref[sk-d-trace]{\tr_A}\bigl(T_c(u)\mid R\Gamma_c(X,K)\bigr)
=\hyperref[sk-d-integral]{\int_{\Fix(c)}}\hyperref[sk-d-trace-class]{\Tr_c(u)}.
$$

## Proof

The support $C$ is proper since $a_C=a_Xc_2$ is proper; the fixed scheme
of [sk-d-corr] is closed in $C$ since $X$ is separated.
Use the construction in [sk-d-proper-pushforward] for $(a_X,a_C)$
and apply [sk-p-proper]. By composition of adjunctions in
[sk-thm-sf-package], the pushed coefficient map is exactly [sk-d-operator].
On fixed supports the pushforward is [sk-d-integral].
The point normalization in [sk-p-pairing] identifies the pushed trace
class with the ordinary trace of that operator.
