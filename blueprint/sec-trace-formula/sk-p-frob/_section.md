*Proposition (sketch).*

For the smooth-curve datum, the
local term at $\bar x$ is

$$
\LT_{\bar x}(\varphi_m)=
\hyperref[d:trace]{\tr_A}(F_{x,m}\mid K_{\bar x}).
$$

No local constancy of $K$ at $\bar x$ is assumed.

## Proof

On an affine chart, the fixed algebra is the quotient by
$t_i^{q^m}-t_i$. The Chinese remainder decomposition of these
polynomials makes it a finite product of copies of $k$, with factors
indexed by the rational points of [sk-d-weil]. The monomials
$\prod_i t_i^{e_i}$ with $0\le e_i<q^m$ generate each affine
coordinate algebra over the image of Frobenius. Thus $\Phi_m$ is
finite, hence proper, as required by [sk-d-operator]. Each fixed point
is a reduced clopen component. At $x$, with $a_i=t_i(x)$, one has
$\Phi_m^*(t_i-a_i)=(t_i-a_i)^{q^m}$. Consequently the induced map on
the cotangent space is zero; the graph and diagonal satisfy the curve
general-position hypotheses used in [sk-i-curve-zero].

Use the pieces of [sk-d-curve-pieces]. Open extension in
Extension by zero in [sk-prop-sf-open-closed-triangle] gives
$(K^U)_{\bar x}=0$, so [sk-i-curve-zero]
kills its local term. For that application, base change $X_0$ to
$\mathbf F_{q^m}$ and use $u^U$ as the one-step Weil map; the chosen
point is rational over this field. By [sk-i-additivity], only the closed piece
remains. The two vertical maps $i,i$ are proper. Apply [sk-p-proper]
to the point correspondence. Its map on fixed supports is the
inclusion of $\bar x$, and its coefficient map is exactly
$i^*K\simeq i^*\Phi_m^*K\xrightarrow{i^*\varphi_m}i^*K$.
Proper integration and point normalization in [sk-p-local] give
the trace asserted in [sk-d-local-term].
