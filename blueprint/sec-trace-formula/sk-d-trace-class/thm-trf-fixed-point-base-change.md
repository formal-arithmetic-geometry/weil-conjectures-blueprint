Fix the global finite-field datum
and the coefficient
conventions, $A=A_{E,n}$, and let
$c=(c_1,c_2):C\to X\times_sX$ be an
admissible
cohomological correspondence with
fixed scheme
$F=\operatorname{Fix}(c)$, so that the
fixed square of
[prop-trf-fixed-square-cartesian] is Cartesian.

1. *Pullback along the ordinary leg.* For
$K\in D^b_{ctf}(X,A)$,
$$
Li_F^*Lc_2^*K\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }Ld^*K,
$$
the functoriality of the
derived pullback along
the equality $c_2i_F=d$.
1. *Base change for the total correspondence.* For
$M\in D^b_{ctf}(C,A)$,
$$
L\Delta_X^*Rc_!M\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }Rd_!Li_F^*M,
$$
the
compact-support base change of the
six-operations package in the Cartesian fixed square. For
$N\in D^b_{ctf}(X,A)$, its right-adjoint form (from the
compatibility of the exchange with the adjunction data of
[def-trf-admissibility]) is
$$
Rc^!R\Delta_{X*}N\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }Ri_{F*}Rd^!N.
$$
