Use the finite coefficient ring
$A=A_{E,n}$. Let

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
U'&\xrightarrow{g_U}&U\\
{\scriptstyle j'}\downarrow&&\downarrow{\scriptstyle j}\\
Y'&\xrightarrow{g}&Y
\end{array}
$$

be a Cartesian square with $j,j'$
open immersions.
On the small pro-etale sites,
the extension-by-zero functors
and derived pullbacks
admit a canonical natural isomorphism

$$
b_g:Lg^*j_!\xrightarrow{\sim}j'_!Lg_U^*.
$$

Its restriction to $U'$ is the identity, after the pullback
identifications. These isomorphisms respect identity squares and
pasting of Cartesian squares.
(Source for the etale version:
[Stacks, Tag 03S6](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03S6),
Lemma 59.70.5, the underived statement $j'_!f'^{-1}=f^{-1}j_!$ on
sheaves; the derived form and the compatibilities are proved below.)

## Proof

Restriction along an open immersion is localization of the site:
an object $V\to U$ is also an object over $Y$.
For a sheaf $Q$ on $Y'$, the direct-image formula gives

$$
(j^*g_*Q)(V)=Q(V\times_Y Y')
=(g_{U*}j'^*Q)(V).
$$

The equality respects restrictions and coverings on the site of
[def-weil-pbc-proetale-site]. Thus $j^*g_*=g_{U*}j'^*$,
with all comparison maps specified on sections.

The exact functor $j'^*$ preserves injectives and K-injectives:
its left adjoint $j'_!$ is exact by
[def-weil-extension-by-zero]. For K-injectives this follows
directly by applying the adjunction to Hom complexes against an
acyclic complex. Thus a K-injective resolution of $Q$ computes
both sides of

$$
j^*Rg_*Q\simeq Rg_{U*}j'^*Q,
$$

using [def-weil-derived-direct-image]. Taking left adjoints,
with the exact inverse-image pullbacks of
[def-weil-derived-pullback-tensor-hom], gives
$Lg^*j_!\simeq j'_!Lg_U^*$. This defines $b_g$.
On $U'$ the section equality is the identity, so its mate has the
stated normalization. The section equalities for two pasted squares
compose to the equality for the outer square. The uniqueness of
left adjoints with their adjunction data proves the pasting and
identity assertions. This proof uses no claim that ordinary
geometric stalks detect arbitrary pro-etale sheaves.
