*Proposition (sketch).*

Compact cohomology and geometric stalks commute with finite-level
coefficient reduction, with their specified Frobenius
maps.

## Proof

For a homomorphism $A\to B$ of finite coefficient rings annihilated by
integers invertible in $k$, derived scalar extension $-\otimes_A^{\mathrm L}B$
preserves bounded constructibility and finite Tor amplitude by
[sk-thm-sf-ctf-stability], and commutes with the operations of
[sk-d-six] by the natural comparison maps. Applying this to
$Ra_{X!}$ and to a geometric stalk gives the two displayed compatibilities,
and the comparisons are natural, hence compatible with the Frobenius maps
of [sk-d-weil]. For an adic system the same statement holds levelwise,
the transition maps being the reductions of one another.
