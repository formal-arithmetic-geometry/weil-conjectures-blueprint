The supported-class bijection of
[def-trf-correspondence], followed by the Kunneth–Verdier
isomorphism [thm-trf-kunneth-verdier], turns $u$ at a point into
$(u\otimes1)\operatorname{coev}_P:A\to Q\otimes_A^{\mathrm L}P^\vee$, and
similarly for $v$. In the recipe of
[def-trf-supported-pairing], contraction of these two classes cancels
the adjacent evaluation–coevaluation pair by a triangle identity. What
remains is precisely the composite defining the categorical trace of
[def-trf-categorical-trace], with endomorphism $vu$; the graded
signs are fixed by the formal laws [prop-trf-trace-formal-laws].
This proves the normalization.

The same adjunction calculation identifies the *diagonal
specialization* on any $X$: if $f:\Fix(c)\to X$ is the canonical map,
its exceptional adjoint is

$$
Rf_!A_{\Fix(c)}\simeq\Delta^*Rc_!A_C
\xrightarrow{\Delta^*\widetilde u}K\otimes_A^{\mathrm L}D_XK
\xrightarrow{\mathrm{ev}\circ\mathrm{sym}}\omega_X .
$$

Indeed, under the tensor–Hom adjunction and biduality ([thm-trf-verdier-biduality]) of
[def-trf-dualizing-complex], the class of the diagonal identity maps
to $1_K$, and the supported cup product reduces by the projection
formula and $!$-base change to the displayed composite. This is the
classical trace-class dictionary used by the proper-comparison input on
the specific representatives.
