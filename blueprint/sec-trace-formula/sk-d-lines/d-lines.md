Over a finite field $F$ from the coefficient setup,
put $\mathbf A^1_F=\operatorname{Spec}F[t]$.
Glue $\operatorname{Spec}F[t]$ to $\operatorname{Spec}F[z]$ along
$F[t,t^{-1}]=F[z,z^{-1}]$, with $z=t^{-1}$, to obtain $\mathbf P^1_F$.
The first chart is $\mathbf A^1_F$ and its complement is the point
$\infty$ defined by $z=0$. Frobenius acts by $t\mapsto t^{|F|}$ and
$z\mapsto z^{|F|}$ on these charts.
