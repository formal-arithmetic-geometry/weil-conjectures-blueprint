Let $A$ be an abelian variety [def-sc-abelian-variety] over a field $k$,
let $\mathcal N$ be an invertible $\mathcal O_A$-module with
$[-1]^*\mathcal N\cong\mathcal N$, and let $n\geq1$. Then
$$
 [n]^*\mathcal N\cong\mathcal N^{\otimes n^2},
$$
where $[n]$ is the multiplication map of [def-sc-mult-n].

## Proof

*Reference: Stacks Project, Groupoid Schemes, Lemma 39.9.7, [Tag
0BFF](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BFF).* Pull the relation of
[thm-sc-theorem-of-cube] back along $x\mapsto(x,x,-x)$: since
$m_{123}(x,x,-x)=x$, $m_1(x,x,-x)=m_2(x,x,-x)=x$, $m_3(x,x,-x)=-x$,
$m_{12}(x,x,-x)=2x$, and $m_{13}(x,x,-x)=m_{23}(x,x,-x)=0$, one gets
$\mathcal L^{\otimes3}\otimes[-1]^*\mathcal L\cong[2]^*\mathcal L$ for
every $\mathcal L$, hence $[2]^*\mathcal N\cong\mathcal N^{\otimes4}$ for
symmetric $\mathcal N$. Next pull the relation back along
$x\mapsto(x,x,[n-1]x)$: $m_{123}(x,x,[n-1]x)=[n+1]x$,
$m_1=m_2=\mathrm{id}$, $m_3=[n-1]$, $m_{12}=[2]$, and $m_{13}=m_{23}=[n]$,
so
$$
 [n+1]^*\mathcal N\otimes\mathcal N^{\otimes2}\otimes
 [n-1]^*\mathcal N
 \cong[2]^*\mathcal N\otimes[n]^*\mathcal N^{\otimes2}.
$$
By induction on $n$ (the case $n=2$ was just done, and $n=1$ is the
identity), the induction hypothesis
$[m]^*\mathcal N\cong\mathcal N^{\otimes m^2}$ for $m\leq n$ gives
$$
 [n+1]^*\mathcal N\cong\mathcal N^{\otimes(4+2n^2-2-(n-1)^2)}
 =\mathcal N^{\otimes(n+1)^2},
$$
as required.
