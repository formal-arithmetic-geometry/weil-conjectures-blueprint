In the purity conventions of this chapter ([def-pur-conventions] fixed setting),
$A=A_{E,n}$, and write $p_d:\mathbf A^d_Y\to Y$ for the projection of
[def-sbc-affine-space], $d\geq0$, obtained as the iterated composite
of $d$ affine-line projections. For every $K\in D^b_{ctf}(Y,\Lambda)$
define

$$
\gamma_{p_d,K}:Lp_d^*K(d)[2d]\longrightarrow Rp_d^!K
$$

as the ordered composite of the $d$ affine-line purity comparisons
[def-pur-affine-line-purity-comparison], the composition isomorphisms
for the (coherently associative) exceptional inverse image of a composite
morphism, and the additivity isomorphisms for the
Tate twists. For $d=0$,
$\gamma_{p_0,K}$ is the identity of $K$.
