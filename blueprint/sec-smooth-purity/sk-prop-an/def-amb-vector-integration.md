Let $\pi:E\to S$ be a vector bundle of constant
rank $d$, in the sense of
[def-asd-vector-bundle-zero-section]. Its integration
map

$$
t_\pi:R\pi_!A_E(d)[2d]\longrightarrow A_S
$$

is the map which on a trivializing open set is the
affine-space integration of
[lem-amb-affine-space-top-trace], glued over a trivializing cover.
Here $(d)$ denotes the Tate twist.

## Proof

These maps glue as morphisms of sheaves: the source has cohomology only in
degree zero on a trivializing cover, and [lem-amb-linear-trace-invariance]
identifies the maps on every overlap.
