The vanishing of a bounded cone will be checked on its cohomology sheaves in the sense of [def-weil-derived-cohomology-sheaves].
Step 1: the field case. Let the base be an algebraically closed
field and write $H=\mathbf P^{n-1}$ for the hyperplane at infinity
of $\mathbf P^n$, with complement $\mathbf A^n$. By
[thm-pur-rank-one-thom] on the fiber-wise structure, the Künneth
formula for compactly supported cohomology
[cor-kun-compact-kunneth] of the Künneth chapter — the
*compact-support* statement, which is not the closed-support Künneth
[lem-pur-kunneth-supported]: cohomology with support in the whole space
is ordinary cohomology, whereas $R\Gamma_c$ is computed on a
compactification — and induction,

$$
R\Gamma_c(\mathbf A^n,\Lambda)\;\cong\;\Lambda(-n)[-2n].
$$

Apply the open–closed localization triangle of
[def-weil-open-closed-recollement] to
$\mathbf A^n\subset\mathbf P^n$. By induction on $n$,
restriction to $H$ identifies $1,h,\ldots,h^{n-1}$ with the
corresponding basis of $R\Gamma(H,\Lambda)$, and the remaining class
$h^n$ restricts to zero on $H$. Choose $n$ hyperplanes whose
intersection is the origin of the affine chart; the product of their
localized Kummer classes is supported at the origin, and after
forgetting support and extending to $\mathbf P^n$ it is
$h^n$; under the Künneth isomorphism this supported product is the
generator of
$R\Gamma_c(\mathbf A^n,\Lambda)=\Lambda(-n)[-2n]$ fixed by the
rank-one normalization ([thm-pur-rank-one-local-calculation]).
Therefore

$$
\bigoplus_{a=0}^{n}\Lambda(-a)[-2a]
\xrightarrow{\ (1,h,\ldots,h^n)\ }R\Gamma(\mathbf P^n,\Lambda)
$$

is an isomorphism.

Step 2: the general base. The Kummer class $h_F$ is global; the
class of the divisors in Step 1 is the one of
[lem-pur-divisor-class] (the frame class of the
$\mathbf P^n$-bundle, with the independence of
[lem-pur-frame-independence]), so the morphism of the statement
is defined before taking any fiber. Proper base change
([prop-weil-proet-finite-proper-base-change]) with
[cor-weil-pbc-geometric-fiber-finite] identifies its pullback to
each geometric point of $B$ with the calculation of Step 1; the
cone is bounded constructible with zero geometric stalks, hence zero.
The same argument for the pullbacks proves base-change compatibility.
This proof used only the rank-one Thom calculation, Künneth,
localization, and proper base change.
