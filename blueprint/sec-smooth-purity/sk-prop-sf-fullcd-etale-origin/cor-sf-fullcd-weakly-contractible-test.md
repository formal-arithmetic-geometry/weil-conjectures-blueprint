In the setting of [def-weil-full-cohomological-dimension] the
condition $\operatorname{FullCD}(p,A;c)$ is equivalent to the following:
for every sheaf $\mathcal F$ of $A$-modules on
$\overline X_{\Proet}$ and every affine weakly contractible object
$W\to Y$ of $Y_{\Proet}$ the evaluations
$\mathcal H^r(Rp_*\mathcal F)(W)$ vanish for $r>c$, and the same holds
after every pro-étale base change of $p$. In particular the test of
$\operatorname{FullCD}$ needs no computation of geometric-point stalks,
and the failure of conservativity of the geometric-point stalks recorded in
clause (4) of [lem-cbc-proetale-stalk-conservative] does not obstruct
it.

## Proof

The cohomology sheaves $\mathcal H^r(Rp_*\mathcal F)$ vanish for $r>c$
if and only if their evaluations at all affine weakly contractible objects
of $Y_{\Proet}$ vanish, by
[lem-sf-proetale-vanishing-detection](i) applied on $Y_{\Proet}$;
this is the first equivalence. The relative clause is the same statement
applied to the base-changed morphisms $p_V$, with the same detection
device on $V_{\Proet}$, which is legitimate because the base change of a
proper finite-type morphism is proper of finite type. The last sentence
restates the detection device used.
