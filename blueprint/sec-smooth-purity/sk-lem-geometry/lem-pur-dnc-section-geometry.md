In the purity conventions of this chapter ([def-pur-conventions] fixed setting), in the situation of
[def-pur-dnc-section-family] with $g:V\to B$ smooth of pure
relative dimension $d$ and $N_s\to B$ the normal bundle of the
section:

1. *the fibers.* The fiber of $\widetilde g$ over $1$ is
$(g:V\to B,s)$ and the fiber over $0$ is the
$\pi_N:N_s\to B$ with its zero section; hence by the
base-change compatibility of [def-pur-co-smoothness]
(applied to the closed immersions $i_1,i_0$ of the two
sections of $\mathbf A^1_B$),
$$
\qquad i_1^*F\simeq C(g,s),\qquad
i_0^*F\simeq C(\pi_N,0_N).\qquad\text{(the two fibers)}
$$
1. *the coordinates.* Since $s$ is a section of a smooth
map, etale-locally there are coordinates $x_1,\dots,x_d$ on
$V$ over $B$ in which $s$ is given by $x_i=0$ (the
relative form of the local linearization of
[lem-pur-regular-immersion-linearization], via
[sbc-thm-etale-local-normal-form]); on the DNC chart the
coordinates are $u_i=x_i/t$, so $\widetilde g$ is smooth of
pure relative dimension $d$.
1. *the punctured trivialization.* Over $\mathbf G_{m,B}$
the deformation space is canonically
$$
D_sV|_{\mathbf G_{m,B}}\simeq V\times_B\mathbf G_{m,B},
\qquad \widetilde s|_{\mathbf G_{m,B}}=s\times 1,
$$
so base change for the cohomologically smooth $\widetilde g$
gives the canonical isomorphism
$$
\kappa^\circ:j^*F\;\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }\;j^*a^*C(g,s),
\qquad a:\mathbf A^1_B\to B.
$$
1. *the standard pair.* For the standard pair
$(\mathbf A^d_B\to B,0)$, the deformation space is
$\mathbf A^d_{B}\times_B\mathbf A^1_B$ with $x_k=tu_k$, the
family object is the pullback $a^*\bigl(0^*\omega_{\mathbf A^d_B/B}\bigr)$, and $0^*\omega_{\mathbf A^d_B/B}=\Lambda(d)[2d]$ by the vector-bundle purity of
[cor-pur-vector-bundle-purity].
1. *base change.* The Rees-algebra description of the
deformation space for a closed section, the punctured
trivialization, and the family object commute with base change
in $B$.
