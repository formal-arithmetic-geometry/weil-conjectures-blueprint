In the purity conventions of this chapter ([def-pur-conventions] fixed setting),
let $f:X\to Y$ be smooth,
separated, of pure
relative dimension $d$, and put $W=X\times_YX$ with projections
$p_1,p_2$ and diagonal $\Delta:X\hookrightarrow W$. Then $\Delta$
is a regular closed immersion of
pure codimension $d$.

## Proof

By [sbc-thm-etale-local-normal-form], $f$ is etale locally the
projection $\mathbf A^d_Y\to Y$; on the model, $\Delta$ is the zero
section of $\mathbf A^d$, a regular closed immersion of codimension
$d$ with normal bundle the trivial rank-$d$ bundle, which under the
identification is $T_{X/Y}$. Regular immersions, their codimension
and their normal bundles are etale local (and compatible with etale
base change), hence the assertion.
