**Content.** For a smooth separated $f\colon X\to Y$ of relative dimension $d$, the section proves $Rf^{!}K\cong Lf^{*}K(d)[2d]$, first with finite coefficients $A_{E,n}$ and then with coefficients $\mathcal O_E$, $E$ and $\overline{\mathbf Q}_\ell$. It begins with the six-functor objects and earlier results that the proof needs, placed here so they come before it: the operations [det-def-sf-operations], base change [sk-prop-sf-cbc], the composition law [sk-thm-sf-comp-composition], the open–closed triangle [sk-prop-sf-open-closed-triangle] and the projection formula [sk-thm-sf-pf-finite]. The proof itself has five moves. (1) A Kummer computation identifies $Rs^{!}\Lambda(1)[2]$ for the zero section of $\mathbf A^1$ with $\Lambda$ ([sk-prop-a1-kummer], [sk-prop-a1]). (2) $\mathbf A^1$-invariance [sk-prop-a1-inv] carries this to $\mathbf A^n$ and to vector bundles, which gives the Thom class [sk-prop-an]. (3) Smooth morphisms are cohomologically smooth [sk-prop-cohsm]. (4) The deformation to the normal cone of a section leaves the section invariant unchanged [sk-thm-dnc]. (5) Applying (4) to the diagonal, a regular immersion by [sk-lem-diag-reg], with normal bundle $T_{X/Y}$, gives $\omega_f\cong\Lambda_X(d)[2d]$. Purity for regular closed immersions then follows through the co-projection [sk-lem-coprojection].

**Key theorem.**

- Thm [sk-thm-smooth-purity] (finite-coefficient smooth purity): for $f$ smooth separated of pure relative dimension $d$, $\omega_f=Rf^{!}\Lambda_Y\cong\Lambda_X(d)[2d]$ canonically, so $Rf^{!}K\cong Lf^{*}K(d)[2d]$ for $K\in D^b_{ctf}(Y,\Lambda)$, compatibly with base change and composition. Used in §[sec-six-functors], §[sec-poincare-duality], §[sec-zeta-weil].
- Thm [sk-thm-purity-transport] (purity over $\mathcal O_E$, $E$, $\overline{\mathbf Q}_\ell$): the purity map $\gamma_{f,K}\colon Lf^{*}K(d)[2d]\xrightarrow{\sim}Rf^{!}K$ extends to the adic, rational and $\overline{\mathbf Q}_\ell$ admissible coefficient rings. Used in §[sec-six-functors], §[sec-poincare-duality], §[sec-deligne-laumon-a1], §[sec-zeta-weil].
- Thm [sk-thm-regular] (purity for regular closed immersions): for $i\colon Z\hookrightarrow X$ regular of pure codimension $c$, with $X$ smooth over $k$ and $Z$ regular, $Ri^{!}\Lambda_X(c)[2c]$ is a rank-one sheaf in degree $0$, trivialized by a canonical fundamental class $\operatorname{cl}_i\in H^{2c}_Z(X,\Lambda(c))$ built from Kummer boundaries of local equations. Used in §[sec-six-functors], §[sec-poincare-duality], §[sec-purity-real-sheaves].
