Let $k$ be a field, let $N$ be an integer prime to
$\operatorname{char}(k)$, and let $\Lambda$ be a finite commutative
ring annihilated by $N$. Say that the *direct-image finiteness
input over $k$* holds if the following two clauses hold.

1. (*finiteness of the direct image*) For every morphism
$u:S\to T$ of
finite type between
finite-type $k$-schemes, every
constructible
$\Lambda$-sheaf $F$ on
$S_{{\mathrm{et}}}$, and every $q\geq0$, the higher direct image
$R^qu_*F$ of [def-weil-pbc-direct-image] is constructible on
$T_{{\mathrm{et}}}$.
1. (*cohomological dimension*) Let $K$ be a separably closed
field with $\operatorname{char}(K)$ prime to $N$, and let $W$
be a finite-type $K$-scheme of dimension at most $d$. Then
$H^q(W,M)=0$ for every $q>2d$ and every torsion sheaf of abelian
groups $M$ on $W_{{\mathrm{et}}}$.
