The only hypothesis of [thm-pur-general-admissibility] is the
open-complement condition
([def-exc-open-complement-bound]) for the finitely many complements of
the affine charts inside affine space; the ambient exceptional right adjoint
datum is not one, being the theorem
[cor-sf-ambient-adjoint-discharge] on the coefficients it quantifies
over. That condition is a theorem of this
blueprint, not an assumption: [lem-exc-open-complement-known] derives
it with $c=2d$ from the two clauses of the direct-image finiteness input
[def-exc-direct-image-input], which are
[thm-dg-finite-type-constructibility] of the constructibility chapter and
[thm-sc-finite-type-torsion-cd] of the Jacobian chapter,
assembled as [thm-exc-direct-image-input-holds], and
[thm-pur-open-complement-unconditional] records the same two clauses with
a constant independent of the coefficient ring and hence of the coefficient
stage. Consequently
[thm-pur-general-admissibility] and
[cor-pur-general-admissibility-datum] prove the two preservation
clauses for an arbitrary separated finite-type morphism without further
hypotheses, on the coefficients of the blueprint's class. No
affineness of the base is needed: the passage from the affine opens of
$Y$ to $Y$ itself uses the base-change compatibility of the ambient
right adjoint along an open immersion, which is proved in the chapter on
exceptional right adjoints
([cor-exc-base-change-open-immersion-general]) and is read here on the
same coefficients, where its ambient-datum hypothesis is again the theorem
[cor-sf-ambient-adjoint-discharge].
