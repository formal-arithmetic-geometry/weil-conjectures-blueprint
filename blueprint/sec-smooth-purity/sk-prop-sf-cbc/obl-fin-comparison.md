Let $k$ be a field of characteristic prime to $N$, let $\Lambda$ be
the finite commutative ring annihilated by $N$ of
[sbc-def-coefficient-conventions], let $S$ be of finite type over
$k$, let $f:X\to S$ be a
proper morphism whose
geometric fibres have
dimension at most $d\in\mathbf Z_{\geq0}$, and let $F$ be a
constructible
$\Lambda$-sheaf on $X_{{\mathrm{et}}}$. Then:

1. **(i)** (*the comparison*) For every $q\geq0$ and every
geometric point
$\bar s$ of $S$, the comparison map of
[cor-weil-pbc-geometric-fiber-finite]
$$
(R^qf_*F)_{\bar s}\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }
H^q\bigl(X_{\bar s},F|_{X_{\bar s}}\bigr)
$$
is an isomorphism; each fibre-cohomology group
$H^q(X_{\bar s},F|_{X_{\bar s}})$ is a finite $\Lambda$-module;
and these groups vanish for $q>2d$.
1. **(ii)** (*the finitude*) The higher direct images
$R^qf_*F$ of [def-weil-pbc-direct-image] are
constructible
on $S_{{\mathrm{et}}}$ for every $q\geq0$, and
$R^qf_*F=0$ for $q>2d$.

## Proof

Constructibility follows from
[thm-fin-proper-constructibility-complete], applied to the given
proper morphism and constructible coefficient sheaf.
For every geometric point $\bar s$, proper base change
[cor-weil-pbc-geometric-fiber-finite] identifies

$$
(R^qf_*F)_{\bar s}=H^q(X_{\bar s},F|_{X_{\bar s}}).
$$

The right side is zero above twice the specified fibre-dimension
bound by [fin4-lem-fibrewise-cohomological-dimension].
Geometric stalk conservativity
[lemma-weil-pbc-geometric-stalk-conservative] proves the sheaf vanishing.
Each fibre group is finite because constructible sheaves have finite
stalks by [def-weil-pbc-constructible-complexes].
The constructibility proof uses finite resolutions and proper
modifications; the sharp bound is obtained separately from this
geometric-fibre calculation.
