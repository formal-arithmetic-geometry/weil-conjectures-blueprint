The shift and distinguished triangles of [def-weil-pbc-common-stage-cones]
satisfy the four Verdier axioms:

1. every morphism has a distinguished cone triangle, the identity triangle
   is distinguished, and distinguishedness is closed under isomorphism;
2. a triangle is distinguished if and only if its signed rotation is
   distinguished;
3. every commutative square between the first arrows of two distinguished
   triangles extends to a morphism of triangles;
4. cone triangles for composable maps can be placed in an octahedral diagram
   whose required faces commute and whose remaining cone triangle is
   distinguished.

Consequently $\mathcal P_T$ is an ordinary triangulated category. Every
finite-stage inclusion $j_E:\mathcal C_E(T)\to\mathcal P_T$ is exact, and
the identifications $j_FT_{F/E}\simeq j_E$ are exact natural isomorphisms.

*Source note:* no Stacks Project entry states this verification: the four
axioms verified here are exactly Stacks Project, Derived Categories,
Definition 13.3.2 ([Tag 0145](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0145),
fetched and quoted: "the definition of a triangulated category as given in
Verdier's thesis", an additive category with an additive auto-equivalence
$[1]$ and a set of distinguished triangles subject to TR1--TR4, TR4 being
the octahedral axiom); the triangles and their morphisms are Definition
13.3.1 ([Tag 0144](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0144)) and the exact
functors of the last sentence are Definition 13.3.3 ([Tag
014V](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/014V)). The closest verification
of the axioms in Stacks for a category that is constructed rather than
assumed is Proposition 13.5.6 ([Tag
05R6](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/05R6)), which proves TR1--TR4 for
a localization $S^{-1}\mathcal D$ whose distinguished triangles are by
definition the images of distinguished triangles of $\mathcal D$, and Lemma
13.4.15 ([Tag 014C](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/014C)) is the
normal form for TR4. The blueprint adds the verification for the triangles
of [def-weil-pbc-common-stage-cones] together with the exactness of the
finite-stage inclusions $j_E$.

## Proof

TR1: every morphism has a cone triangle by
[def-weil-pbc-common-stage-cones]; the identity triangle is the cone
triangle of an identity (cone zero), and distinguishedness is closed under
isomorphism by the definition. TR2: by
[prop-weil-pbc-common-stage-calculus] a distinguished triangle and its
signed rotation may be represented over one common finite field, so the
finite-stage TR2 axiom makes the signed rotation distinguished (the shift in
the signed rotation being the $\sigma$-comparison of the definition). TR3:
given a commutative square between the first arrows of two distinguished
triangles, represent the two triangles over one common finite field (using
the transport isomorphisms of
[def-weil-pbc-finite-stage-pair-category]) and apply the finite-stage TR3
axiom; the resulting vertical arrow transports back to $\mathcal P_T$. TR4:
the same common-stage representation of two composable morphisms, together
with the cone independence of [prop-weil-pbc-cone-independence], and the
finite-stage TR4 axiom produce the octahedral diagram whose remaining cone
triangle is distinguished. Hence $\mathcal P_T$ is an ordinary triangulated
category; $j_E$ is exact because cone triangles of $j_E(f)$ are the
corresponding common-stage cone triangles, and the identifications
$j_FT_{F/E}\simeq j_E$ are exact natural isomorphisms by
[prop-weil-pbc-cone-independence].
