Let $(A,I)$ satisfy [def-weil-pbc-adic-coefficient-datum], let
$\square$ be a
compact-support
base-change square with $f$ separated of finite type and
$g:Y'\to Y$ arbitrary, and let $K\in D(X_{\Proet},A)$ be derived
$I$-complete whose reductions $K_n$ carry compatible
etale-origin witnesses.
Then

$$
\Ex^{\mathrm{comp}}_!(K):
Lg^*_{\mathrm{comp}}Rf_!K
\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }Rf'_!Lg'^*_{\mathrm{comp}}K
$$

of [def-cbc-completed-exchange-map] is an isomorphism, natural
in $K$ and coherent for identities and pasted squares.

## Proof

Choose a compactification $c=(j,p)$ of $f$ and its base change
$c'$; the composite defining
[def-cbc-completed-exchange-map] consists of two
isomorphisms: the completed proper base change
[thm-weil-pbc-complete-proetale] applied to the proper $p$
(the hypotheses hold: $j_!K$ is derived $I$-complete by the
exactness of [lem-cbc-proetale-extension-zero], and its
reductions $j_!K_n$ carry the witnesses $j_!L_n$ if the
witnesses of $K$ are $L_n$), and the completed
extension-by-zero comparison
[lem-cbc-completed-extension-zero-comparison]. Hence
$\Ex^{\mathrm{comp}}_!(K)$ is an isomorphism, and it is
independent of the compactification and natural by the corresponding
properties of the two factors (the coherence of
[def-cbc-exchange-map] and of the completed map of
[thm-weil-pbc-complete-proetale], with the compatibility of the
comparisons of [def-compact-support-direct-image-detailed] with the
completed maps).
