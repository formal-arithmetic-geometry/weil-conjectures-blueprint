Let $\mathcal A$ be a Grothendieck abelian coefficient category (for
instance $\mathcal A=\mathrm{Mod}_\Lambda$), and assume that the
constructible sheaves in $\shv{\et X}$ are closed under kernels, cokernels
and extensions. Then the full subcategory of the derived category
$D(\shv{\et X})$ consisting of the complexes all of whose cohomology
sheaves are constructible is a triangulated subcategory, and so is its full
subcategory $D^b_c(\et X)$ of bounded such complexes.

More generally, in the derived category of any abelian category, the
complexes all of whose cohomology objects lie in a class of objects that
contains zero and is closed under isomorphisms, kernels, cokernels and
extensions form a triangulated subcategory.

## Proof

For a weak Serre subcategory $\mathcal C$ of an abelian category, the
complexes with cohomology in $\mathcal C$ form a triangulated subcategory
of the derived category: the zero object and shifts are clear, and for a
distinguished triangle $K\to L\to M\to K[1]$ with $K$ and $M$ having
cohomology in $\mathcal C$, the long exact cohomology sequence
$H^{n}(K)\to H^n(L)\to H^n(M)$ exhibits $H^n(L)$ as an extension of a
subobject of $H^n(M)$ (a kernel) by a quotient of $H^n(K)$ (a cokernel),
both in $\mathcal C$, hence $H^n(L)\in\mathcal C$. Apply this to the weak
Serre subcategory of [thm-constructible-serre]. (In the formalisation the
general statement is `DerivedCategory.homologyProperty_isTriangulated`, for any
property of objects closed under isomorphisms, kernels, cokernels and extensions; it is
applied to the constructible sheaves with these closure properties, the content of
[thm-constructible-serre], as hypotheses.)
