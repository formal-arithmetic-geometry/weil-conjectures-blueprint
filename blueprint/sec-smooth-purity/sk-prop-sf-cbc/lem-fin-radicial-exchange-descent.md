Let $S'\to S$ be finite, surjective and radicial, and let
$j:X\hookrightarrow Y$ be an open immersion of finite-type
$S$-schemes with a constructible finite sheaf $F$ on $X$.
Suppose the direct image after base change to $S'$ is bounded
constructible and its formation commutes with every further base
change from a Noetherian scheme. Then the same assertions hold over $S$.

## Proof

By [thm-weil-pbc-universal-homeomorphism-invariance], pullback
by a universal homeomorphism is an exact equivalence of etale
topoi. It preserves constructibility in both directions: the
underlying spaces are homeomorphic, and finite locally constant
sheaves correspond on every stratum under that equivalence.
The equivalence intertwines the direct-image functor for $j$
with the corresponding functor for its pullback, including their
derived functors. Therefore it detects boundedness and
constructibility of $Rj_*F$.
For any Noetherian $T$ and morphism $T\to S$, the pullback $T'=T\times_SS'\to T$
is again a universal homeomorphism by
[lem-weil-pbc-universal-homeomorphism-base-change].
Pull back the proposed exchange morphism to $Y_{T'}$.
Compatibility of exchange with composition in
[sbc-lem-base-change-composition] identifies it, through the
same equivalences, with the exchange over $S'$, which is an
isomorphism by hypothesis. The pullback equivalence is
conservative, so the original exchange is an isomorphism.
