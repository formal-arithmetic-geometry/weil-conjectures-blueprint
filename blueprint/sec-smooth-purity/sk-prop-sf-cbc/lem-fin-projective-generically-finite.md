Let $A$ be a Noetherian domain with fraction field $K$, and let
$D\to\operatorname{Spec}A$ be
projective.
If $D_K$ has dimension at most zero, this morphism is finite after
restriction to a nonempty open of $\operatorname{Spec}A$.

## Proof

Embed $D$ into $\mathbf P^N_A$.
The finite $K$-scheme $D_K$ is affine with Artinian coordinate
ring. An invertible module on an Artinian ring is free on each
local factor, hence is free of rank one. For sufficiently large
$m$, the exact sequence of its ideal sheaf, twisted by
$\mathcal O(m)$, and
[lem-pc-projective-space-serre-vanishing] show that

$$
H^0(\mathbf P^N_K,\mathcal O(m))
\longrightarrow H^0(D_K,\mathcal O(m)|_{D_K})
$$

is surjective. Choose a generator on $D_K$ and lift it to a
homogeneous polynomial $P$; the twist has the meaning of
[def-pc-projective-space-twist].
If $D_K$ is empty, any homogeneous polynomial suffices.
Clear denominators so that $P$ is defined over an open of the base.
The closed subset $D\cap V_+(P)$ is proper over the base and has
empty generic fibre. By [lem-weil-pbc-proper-closed-image],
remove its closed image. Now $D$ is a closed subscheme of the
affine $D_+(P)$, so it is affine over the remaining affine base.
Its coordinate algebra is finite as a base module by the already
proved coherent finiteness
[lem-pc-projective-coherent-finiteness], applied to $\mathcal O_D$.
An affine morphism with finite coordinate algebra is finite.
