For composable
open immersions
$U\hookrightarrow V\hookrightarrow X$, the canonical comparison

$$
(j_2)_!(j_1)_!F\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }(j_2j_1)_!F
$$

is an isomorphism, natural in $F$ and compatible with the identity
open immersion and the two ways of composing three open immersions.

## Proof

All three functors are left adjoint to the corresponding inverse
image functors, and the two candidates are the left adjoints of the
same functor $((j_2j_1)^{-1}=(j_1)^{-1}(j_2)^{-1})$, so they are
canonically isomorphic (the comparison being the mate of the
identification of inverse images); naturality and the coherence
equations follow from the adjunction calculus, as in
[def-weil-pbc-extension-by-zero].
