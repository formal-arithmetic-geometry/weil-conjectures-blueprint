Let $\nu_X:X_{\Proet}\to X_{\Et}$ be the comparison morphism of
[def-weil-pbc-site-comparison-morphism]. For an open immersion
$j:U\hookrightarrow X$ and a finite commutative ring $\Lambda$ the
canonical comparison

$$
\nu_X^*j^{\mathrm{et}}_!F\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }j^{\mathrm{proet}}_!\nu_U^*F
$$

is an isomorphism for every sheaf $F$ of $\Lambda$-modules on
$U_{\Et}$, naturally in $F$ and compatible with composition of
open immersions; here the two $j_!$ are those of
[def-weil-pbc-extension-by-zero] and
[def-weil-extension-by-zero].

## Proof

Both sides are left adjoints of functors to the sheaves on
$U_{\Proet}$, and we identify their right adjoints.
By [def-weil-pbc-site-comparison-morphism] the inverse image
$\nu_X^*$ is left adjoint to $\nu_{X*}$, and it is computed on the
objects common to the two sites; by
[def-weil-pbc-extension-by-zero] and
[def-weil-extension-by-zero] the functors
$j^{\mathrm{et}}_!$ and $j^{\mathrm{proet}}_!$ are left adjoint to
the corresponding restriction along $j$. For a sheaf $M$ on
$X_{\Proet}$ the two Hom-functors in $F$ are therefore

$$
\operatorname{Hom}\bigl(\nu_X^*j^{\mathrm{et}}_!F,M\bigr)
\cong\operatorname{Hom}\bigl(j^{\mathrm{et}}_!F,\nu_{X*}M\bigr)
\cong\operatorname{Hom}\bigl(F,j^{\mathrm{et},-1}\nu_{X*}M\bigr),
$$

$$
\operatorname{Hom}\bigl(j^{\mathrm{proet}}_!\nu_U^*F,M\bigr)
\cong\operatorname{Hom}\bigl(\nu_U^*F,j^{-1}M\bigr)
\cong\operatorname{Hom}\bigl(F,\nu_{U*}j^{-1}M\bigr).
$$

The two right adjoints agree as functors to sheaves on $U_{\Et}$.
Indeed, for an etale $W\to U$ the under-category of etale
$X$-schemes under $W$ has $W$ itself as initial object, because
$W$ is etale over $X$ as a composite of etale morphisms; hence
both $j^{\mathrm{et},-1}\nu_{X*}M$ and $\nu_{U*}j^{-1}M$ evaluate
at $W$ to $M(W)$, the identification being the restriction of
sections along the open immersion $U\hookrightarrow X$. The two
Hom-functors in $F$ are therefore isomorphic, and by Yoneda the two
left adjoints are canonically isomorphic: this is the displayed
comparison. Naturality in $F$ and compatibility with a composite of
open immersions follow from the same identification of right
adjoints, which is the restriction of sections along an open
immersion and is natural and transitive, as in
[lem-cbc-extension-zero-composition].
