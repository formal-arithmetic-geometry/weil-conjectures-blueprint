Let $u:T_1\to T_2$ be
proper and let
$j_2:X\hookrightarrow T_2$ be an open immersion. For the fibre
product $V=T_1\times_{T_2}X$ with projection $p:V\to X$ of
[def-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison], the morphism $p$ is
proper and therefore
separated.

## Proof

By construction in [def-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison] the square
with sides $u:T_1\to T_2$, $j_2:X\to T_2$, $b:V\to T_1$ and
$p:V\to X$ is cartesian, so $p:V\to X$ is the base change of the
proper morphism $u$ along $j_2$. By
[lem-weil-pbc-proper-base-change] a base change of a proper
morphism is proper, so $p$ is proper, and a proper morphism is
separated by the definition of properness in
[def-weil-pbc-scheme-conventions].
