+++
In the setting of [def-sf-datum], let
$X\xrightarrow{f}Y\xrightarrow{g}Z$ be composable separated finite-type
morphisms, with the adjunctions $Rf_!\dashv Rf^!$, $Rg_!\dashv Rg^!$ and
$R(gf)_!\dashv R(gf)^!$ on the finite-Tor categories supplied by axiom (A1)
of [def-sf-datum] (i.e. the ambient right adjoints of
[def-weil-exceptional-adjoint-admissibility] restricted along its
preservation clause (3)). Then the mate of the composition isomorphism
$R(gf)_!\cong Rg_!Rf_!$ of [thm-sf-comp-composition] under these adjunctions is the isomorphism $(gf)^!\cong f^!g^!$, and the
units and counits of the composite adjunctions are the pasted ones.

## Proof

The pasting of the units and counits is recorded in
[fix-prop-adjunctions]: the functoriality of the mate construction
gives the isomorphism of right adjoints from the isomorphism of left
adjoints $R(gf)_!\cong Rg_!Rf_!$, and the triangle identities of the
composite are the composites of the component ones.
