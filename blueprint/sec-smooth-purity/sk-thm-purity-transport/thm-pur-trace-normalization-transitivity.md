In the purity conventions of this chapter ([def-pur-conventions] fixed setting),
$A=A_{E,n}$, let $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ be smooth separated
morphisms of relative dimensions $d$ and $e$, and let
$K\in D^b_{ctf}(Z,\Lambda)$. The typed composite

$$
\begin{array}{l}
R(gf)_!L(gf)^*K(d+e)[2d+2e]
\xrightarrow{\ \alpha_{g,f}^{-1}\ }
Rg_!Rf_!Lf^*Lg^*K(d+e)[2d+2e]\\
\hphantom{R(gf)_!L(gf)^*K(d+e)[2d+2e]}
\xrightarrow{\ Rg_!(\operatorname{Tr}^{\mathrm{sm}}_{f,Lg^*K(e)[2e]})\ }
Rg_!Lg^*K(e)[2e]
\xrightarrow{\ \operatorname{Tr}^{\mathrm{sm}}_{g,K}\ }K
\end{array}
$$

equals $\operatorname{Tr}^{\mathrm{sm}}_{gf,K}$, after the pullback-composition
and twist-additivity identifications; thus the $f$-trace, with the
$(e)[2e]$ twist already present, is applied before the $g$-trace.
On every geometric fiber of a structural $f=p_d:\mathbf A^d\to\Spec k$,
the smooth trace

$$
\operatorname{Tr}^{\mathrm{sm}}_{p_d,\Lambda}:
R\Gamma_c(\mathbf A^d,\Lambda(d)[2d])\longrightarrow\Lambda
$$

is the product of the normalized affine-line traces of
[thm-pur-affine-line-purity]: it sends the ordered fundamental class
of $\mathbf A^d$, the $d$-fold tensor of the affine-line classes, to
$1\in\Lambda$. The smooth traces are compatible with arbitrary base
change of $Z$ and with the coefficient transports of
[thm-pur-finite-reduction-of-purity],
[thm-pur-adic-reconstruction], and
[thm-pur-rational-and-qbar-purity].

## Proof

Step 1: the transitivity. Expanding the two composites with
[def-pur-smooth-trace], the left-hand composite is

$$
\begin{gathered}
Rg_!Rf_!Lf^*Lg^*K(d+e)[2d+2e]
\\
\xrightarrow{\ Rg_!Rf_!(\gamma_{f,Lg^*K(e)[2e]})\ }
Rg_!Rf_!Rf^!Lg^*K(e)[2e]
\\
\xrightarrow{\ Rg_!(\operatorname{Tr}_{f,Lg^*K(e)[2e]})\ }
Rg_!Lg^*K(e)[2e]
\\
\xrightarrow{\ \operatorname{Tr}^{\mathrm{sm}}_{g,K}\ }K,
\end{gathered}
$$

where the first arrow is the $\alpha_{g,f}^{-1}$-identification of the
statement (the pullback-composition and twist-additivity identifications,
all canonical), and the trace $\operatorname{Tr}_{f,Lg^*K(e)[2e]}$ is
the counit of $Rf_!\dashv Rf^!$ evaluated on $Lg^*K(e)[2e]$. The
transposed form of the purity–composition coherence
[thm-pur-composition-coherence] says that
$Rf_!(\gamma_{f,Lg^*K(e)[2e]})$ followed by the counit is the counit
of $Rf_!\dashv Rf^!$ applied to the object $Lf^*Lg^*K(d+e)[2d+2e]$
through the composition isomorphism $c_{g,f}$ – it identifies
$Rf_!Rf^!Lg^*K(e)[2e]$ with $Rf_!Lf^*Lg^*K(d+e)[2d+2e]$ – so the
composite of the last three displayed arrows is exactly the
$f$-trace $Rg_!(\operatorname{Tr}^{\mathrm{sm}}_{f,Lg^*K(e)[2e]})$,
which is what the statement's composite applies. The remaining
identification is the functoriality of the counits with respect to the
canonical identification $R(gf)_!\cong Rg_!Rf_!$ (the $\alpha_{g,f}$
of the compact-support direct image), the compatibility of the
adjunction with composition being the transpose of the composition
isomorphism of the $R^!$-side (the composition
isomorphism of the $R_!$-side is the transpose of the one of the
$R^!$-side, and the triangle identity of the adjunction
$Rf_!\dashv Rf^!$ is used once, in the form
$\operatorname{Tr}_f\circ Rf_!(\gamma_{f,K})=\operatorname{Tr}_{f,K}$).
Hence the two composites agree, which is the transitivity.
Step 2: the normalization on the geometric fiber. For
$f=p_d:\mathbf A^d\to\Spec k$, the smooth trace
$\operatorname{Tr}^{\mathrm{sm}}_{p_d,\Lambda}$ is, by
[def-pur-smooth-trace], $R\Gamma_c(\gamma_{p_d,\Lambda})$ followed
by the counit, and by the agreement
[lem-pur-projection-purity-agreement] the purity map
$\gamma_{p_d,\Lambda}$ is the affinity-space purity comparison, i.e. the affinity-space integration of
[cor-pur-affine-space-purity]; by induction on $d$ with Step 1
(the case $d+e$ with $e=1$: the $d$-fold trace is the iterate of
the one-fold trace), and with the case $d=1$ being
[thm-pur-affine-line-purity] in adjoint form (the
affine-line integration $\int_p$ of the orientation sends the
fundamental class of $\mathbf A^1$ to $1$, by the normalization of
the orientation in [thm-pur-affine-line-orientation]), the trace
of the ordered fundamental class, the $d$-fold tensor of the
affine-line classes, is the product of the images, i.e.

$$
\operatorname{Tr}^{\mathrm{sm}}_{p_d,\Lambda}\bigl(\underbrace{1\otimes\cdots\otimes1}\bigr)=1\in\Lambda;
$$

the intermediate Koszul signs in the reassociations are $+1$ by
[cor-pur-affine-space-purity] (the shift factors are of even
degree). Step 3: the base-change compatibility. The smooth trace is
compatible with the base change of $Z$ by the conjugation of
[thm-pur-smooth-base-change-coherence] with the compact-support
base change of the adjunctions (the trace is the counit, the counit of
the pulled-back adjunction is the pullback of the counit under the
base-change maps: the base-change compatibility of the adjunction
$Rf_!\dashv Rf^!$). Step 4: the coefficient
transport. The compatibility with finite reduction is the transport
of [thm-pur-finite-reduction-of-purity] (the trace is built from
the purity isomorphism and the counit, both reducing compatibly),
and the adic and rational transports are the corresponding
statements of [thm-pur-adic-reconstruction] and
[thm-pur-rational-and-qbar-purity], which transport the smooth
trace together with the purity isomorphism.
