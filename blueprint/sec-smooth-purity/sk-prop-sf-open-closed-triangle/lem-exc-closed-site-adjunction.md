The functor $v$ is left adjoint to $u$, with $uv$ canonically the identity,
for the functors of [def-exc-closed-site-lift].

## Proof

The adjunction of [def-exc-closed-site-lift] is the opposite of
[lem-exc-closed-lift-adjunction], and its unit is an isomorphism by
[lem-exc-closed-lift-reduction]. The triangle identities are those of the
algebra adjunction with arrows reversed.
