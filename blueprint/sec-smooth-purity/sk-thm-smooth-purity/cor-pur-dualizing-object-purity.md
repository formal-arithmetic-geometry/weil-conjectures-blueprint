In the purity conventions of [def-pur-conventions],
let $f:X\to Y$ be smooth separated of pure relative dimension $d$
and let $K\in D^b_{ctf}(Y,\Lambda)$. Substituting the identification
of [thm-pur-diagonal-dualizing-object] into the tensor formula of
[thm-pur-cohomological-smoothness] gives the canonical
isomorphism

$$
Lf^*K(d)[2d]\;\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }\;Rf^!K.
$$

Every map involved was normalized by the projective-line trace (the
Kummer generator up to the sign $(-1)^d$), so the Tate
twist, shift, and trace normalization are fixed canonically; the
identification is compatible with arbitrary base change and
composition.
