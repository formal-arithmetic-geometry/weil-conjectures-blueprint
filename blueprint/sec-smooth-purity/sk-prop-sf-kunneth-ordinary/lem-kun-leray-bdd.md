For a morphism of schemes $f:X\to Y$ and
$E\in\Dplus(X_{\Et})$ there is a canonical isomorphism

$$
\RGamma(X_{\Et},E)\cong\RGamma\bigl(Y_{\Et},Rf_*E\bigr)
$$

in $\Dplus(\mathbf Z)$, compatible with the functorialities (this is
the composition of the derived functors of
$\Gamma(X_{\Et},-)=\Gamma(Y_{\Et},-)\circ f_*$).

## Proof

Choose a K-injective resolution $E\to I$
([prop-weil-pbc-kinjective-resolutions-exist]). Then
$Rf_*E=f_*I$, and by [def-kun-rgamma-unbounded] and
[def-weil-pbc-direct-image]

$$
\RGamma(X_{\Et},E)=\Gamma(X_{\Et},I)=\Gamma(Y_{\Et},f_*I),
$$

while $\RGamma(Y_{\Et},Rf_*E)=\Gamma(Y_{\Et},J)$ for any K-injective
model $J$ of $f_*I$; these objects are independent of the chosen
K-injective models by [lem-kun-rgamma-unbounded-well-defined], and
for the bounded-below object $E$ they agree with the derived global
sections of [def-weil-pbc-etale-cohomology] by
[lem-kun-rgamma-unbounded-bounded]. Both
$\Gamma(Y_{\Et},f_*I)$ and
$\Gamma(Y_{\Et},J)$ compute the derived functors of the composite
$\Gamma(Y_{\Et},-)\circ f_*=\Gamma(X_{\Et},-)$: this is the
Grothendieck spectral sequence of
[lem-weil-pbc-grothendieck-spectral-sequence] applied to the
composite, whose $E_2$-page involves $R^qf_*$ and the higher direct
images of $\Gamma(Y_{\Et},-)$, and which computes the right derived
functors of the composite functor. Hence the comparison
$\Gamma(Y_{\Et},f_*I)\to\Gamma(Y_{\Et},J)$ is a quasi-isomorphism,
and the canonical map $\RGamma(X_{\Et},E)\to \RGamma(Y_{\Et},Rf_*E)$ is an isomorphism, natural in $E$ and
compatible with the functorialities.
