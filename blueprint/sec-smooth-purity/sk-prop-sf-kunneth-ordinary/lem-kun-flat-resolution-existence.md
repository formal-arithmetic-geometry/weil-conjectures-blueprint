Let $\Lambda$ be a commutative ring and $T$ a scheme. Every complex
$\mathcal G^\bullet$ of $\Lambda_T$-module sheaves on the small
etale site of $T$ admits a
quasi-isomorphism $\mathcal K^\bullet\to\mathcal G^\bullet$ from a
K-flat complex whose terms are flat
$\Lambda_T$-module sheaves.
(*Source:* the argument is the one of Stacks Project,
[Lemma 21.17.11, Tag
`06YS`](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/06YS), with the successive approximations replaced by the
functorial replacement below.)

## Proof

Choose a K-injective resolution $I^\bullet$ of
$\mathcal G^\bullet$, as supplied by
[prop-weil-pbc-kinjective-resolutions-exist], and for every $N$
let $\mathcal F_N^\bullet=\tau_{\le N}I^\bullet$ be the
truncation in the sense of [def-kun-truncations], a complex vanishing above $N$.
Applying the functorial replacement
$\Phi$ of [lem-kun-bounded-flat-replacement] to
$\mathcal F_N^\bullet$ with the bound $N+1$ produces a bounded-above
complex $\mathcal E_N^\bullet=\Phi(\mathcal F_N^\bullet)$ of flat
sheaves with a termwise surjective quasi-isomorphism
$\mathcal E_N^\bullet\to\mathcal F_N^\bullet$; since
$\mathcal F_N^\bullet\to\mathcal F_{N+1}^\bullet$ is a map between
complexes vanishing above $N+1$, functoriality gives compatible maps
$\mathcal E_N^\bullet\to\mathcal E_{N+1}^\bullet$.
Each $\mathcal E_N^\bullet$ is a bounded-above complex of flat, hence
[lem-kun-kflat-criteria](1)-K-flat, complexes; therefore the
homotopy colimit
$\mathcal K^\bullet=\operatorname{hocolim}_N\mathcal E_N^\bullet$,
which is the cone of a map between countable direct sums of the
$\mathcal E_N^\bullet$, is K-flat and has flat terms by
[lem-kun-kflat-criteria](2) (direct sums and cones of K-flat
complexes are K-flat, and direct sums of flat sheaves are flat).
The homotopy colimit of the compatible quasi-isomorphisms
$\mathcal E_N^\bullet\to\mathcal F_N^\bullet$ is the termwise colimit
of a filtered system of quasi-isomorphisms by
[lem-kun-complex-colimit-hocolim], hence a quasi-isomorphism
because homology commutes with filtered colimits; and
$\operatorname{hocolim}_N\mathcal F_N^\bullet\cong I^\bullet$ by
[lem-kun-hocolim-truncations], since $I^\bullet$ represents
$\mathcal G^\bullet$ in $D(T_{\Et},\Lambda)$ in the sense of
[def-weil-pbc-derived-categories]. The composite
$\mathcal K^\bullet\to\mathcal G^\bullet$ is therefore the required
quasi-isomorphism.
