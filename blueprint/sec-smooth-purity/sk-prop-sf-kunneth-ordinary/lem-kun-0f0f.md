Let $f:X\to Y$ be a
proper morphism, let
$E\in\Dplus(X_{\Et})$ have
torsion cohomology, and let
$K\in\Dplus(Y_{\Et})$. Then the canonical projection-formula map

$$
\mathrm{PF}_f(E,K):\quad
Rf_*E\kunotimes{\mathbf Z}K\longrightarrow
Rf_*(E\kunotimes{\mathbf Z}f^{-1}K)
$$

is an isomorphism in $\Dplus(Y_{\Et})$.

## Proof

Both sides of [def-kun-projection-formula-map] are triangulated
functors in $K\in\Dplus(Y_{\Et})$
([lem-kun-derived-tensor-triangulated]), and for $K=\mathbf Z$ in degree
zero the map is the identity constraint
$Rf_*E\otimes_{\mathbf Z}\mathbf Z\to Rf_*E$, an isomorphism; the
same holds for a bounded-below complex $F$ of free
$\mathbf Z$-module sheaves, since both sides commute with finite
direct sums and shifts and $f^{-1}$ of a free sheaf is free
(the inverse image is exact, [def-weil-pbc-inverse-image]).
For a general $K\in\Dplus(Y_{\Et})$ choose a quasi-isomorphism
$F\to K$ from a bounded-below complex of free sheaves: such an $F$
exists by the standard Cartan–Eilenberg construction (in each degree
the kernel of the previous map is a quotient of a direct sum of copies
of $\mathbf Z_Y$). Then $F$ is K-flat, so
$Rf_*E\kunotimes{\mathbf Z}K=Rf_*E\otimes F$ and
$E\kunotimes{\mathbf Z}f^{-1}K=E\otimes f^{-1}F$, and the comparison
of the previous paragraph is the assertion; the two identifications are
those of [def-kun-derived-tensor].
