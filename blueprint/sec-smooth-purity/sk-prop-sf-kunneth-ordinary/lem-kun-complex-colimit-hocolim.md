For a sequence of complexes of etale sheaves on a site, the canonical
morphism from its homotopy colimit to its termwise colimit is a
quasi-isomorphism.

## Proof

Write $A=\bigoplus_nE_n$ and $u=1-\text{shift}:A\to A$. Termwise,
$u$ is injective: if $u(x)=0$ then $x_0=0$, then
$x_1=x_0=0$, and inductively $x_n=0$ for all $n$. Hence the
short exact sequence of complexes
$0\to A\xrightarrow{u}A\to\operatorname{coker}(u)\to0$ gives a
distinguished triangle with third term $\operatorname{coker}(u)$
([lem-sp-long-exact-of-triangle]), and in degree $i$ the
cokernel of $1-\text{shift}$ on $\bigoplus_nE_n^i$ is exactly the
colimit $\varinjlim_nE_n^i$; thus
$\operatorname{coker}(u)$ is the termwise colimit of the sequence.
Since the homotopy colimit of [def-kun-truncations] is the third
term of the displayed triangle, it is canonically isomorphic to the
termwise colimit in the derived category.
