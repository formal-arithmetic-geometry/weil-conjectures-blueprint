Let $\Lambda'=\kunZn$, let $M$ be a flat $\Lambda'$-module, let
$n=\ell m$ with $\ell$ a prime dividing $n$, and let $N$ be a
complex of $\Lambda'$-modules annihilated degreewise by $\ell$,
viewed as a complex of $\kunFl$-vector spaces. Then

$$
M\kunotimes{\Lambda'}N\cong(M/\ell M)\kunotimes{\kunFl}N
$$

canonically in $D(\mathrm{Mod}(\Lambda'))$.

## Proof

Since $M$ is flat, the derived tensor product is the underived one.
The sequence

$$
\ell M\longrightarrow M\longrightarrow M/\ell M\longrightarrow0
$$

is right exact and, tensored with $N$, the image of
$\ell M\otimes_{\Lambda'}N$ in $M\otimes_{\Lambda'}N$ is
$\ell(M\otimes_{\Lambda'}N)=M\otimes_{\Lambda'}\ell N=0$, because
$\ell N=0$; hence
$M\otimes_{\Lambda'}N=(M/\ell M)\otimes_{\Lambda'}N$, and the right
side identifies canonically with
$(M/\ell M)\otimes_{\kunFl}N$ since $\ell$ annihilates $N$ and
$M/\ell M$.
