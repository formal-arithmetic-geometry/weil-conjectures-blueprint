*Theorem (sketch).*

Let $i:Z\hookrightarrow X$ be a regular closed immersion of pure codimension
$c$, with $X$ smooth over the perfect field $k$ and $Z$ regular.

*The fundamental class.* A *frame* of $Z$ is an étale
$U\to X$ together with $f_1,\dots,f_c\in\Gamma(U,\mathcal O_U)$ generating
the ideal of $Z_U=Z\times_XU$. Each $f_j$ is a unit on $U\setminus V(f_j)$,
so it has a Kummer class $\kappa(f_j)\in H^1(U\setminus V(f_j),\Lambda(1))$
as in [sk-def-purity-conv], and the boundary of the localization sequence
of $V(f_j)\subset U$ gives
$\partial\kappa(f_j)\in H^2_{V(f_j)}(U,\Lambda(1))$. The *class of
the frame* is the cup product with supports

$$
\operatorname{cl}(f)=\partial\kappa(f_1)\cup\cdots\cup\partial\kappa(f_c)
\ \in\ H^{2c}_{Z_U}\bigl(U,\Lambda(c)\bigr).
$$

Then:
- **(a)** $Ri^{!}\Lambda_X(c)[2c]$ is concentrated in degree $0$ with
$\mathcal H^0$ free of rank one; hence
$H^0(Z,Ri^{!}\Lambda_X(c)[2c])=H^{2c}_Z(X,\Lambda(c))=\Gamma(Z,\mathcal H^0)$,
and likewise after any étale $U\to X$.
- **(b)** $\operatorname{cl}(f)$ depends only on $Z_U\subset U$, not on
the frame, and the frame classes glue to a unique global class, the
*fundamental class*

$$
[Z\subset X]=\operatorname{cl}_{Z/X}\ \in\ H^{2c}_Z\bigl(X,\Lambda(c)\bigr)
=H^0\bigl(Z,Ri^{!}\Lambda_X(c)[2c]\bigr),
$$

which generates $\mathcal H^0$ at every geometric point. (The frame
classes and their gluing make sense for every regular closed immersion;
for the zero section of $\Aaf^1_Y$ the class so defined is
$\mathrm{pur}_s$ of [sk-prop-a1], and for the zero section of $\Aaf^c_B$
it is the generator $\partial\kappa(t_1)\cup\cdots\cup\partial\kappa(t_c)$
of [sk-prop-an] (i), by the definition of those classes; these pairs are
in the situation of the theorem when $Y$, resp. $B$, is smooth over $k$.)
- **(c)** The morphism

$$
\operatorname{cl}_i:\ \Lambda_Z\ \xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }\ Ri^{!}\Lambda_X(c)[2c],
\qquad 1\longmapsto[Z\subset X],
$$

is an isomorphism, and it equals the isomorphism assembled from smooth
purity of $a_X$ and $a_Z$ in Steps 1–2 below. Since twists pass through
$Ri^{!}$ ([sk-lem-coprojection]), equivalently the inverse of
$\operatorname{cl}_i(-c)[-2c]$ is a canonical isomorphism

$$
Ri^{!}\Lambda_X\ \xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }\ \Lambda_Z(-c)[-2c].
$$

- **(d)** It is compatible with étale base change,
$[Z_U\subset U]=[Z\subset X]|_U$, and with exterior products: for two such
pairs $(X_1,Z_1)$, $(X_2,Z_2)$ over $k$, the product
$(X_1\times_kX_2,Z_1\times_kZ_2)$ is again such a pair, of codimension
$c_1+c_2$, and
$[Z_1\times Z_2\subset X_1\times X_2]=[Z_1\subset X_1]\boxtimes[Z_2\subset X_2]$
under the exterior product of classes with supports.

## Proof

*Step 1: the $\omega$-identification.* Work on a connected component of
$X$; the resulting isomorphisms assemble over the disjoint union. By
[sk-lem-regular-smooth], $a_X$ and $a_Z$ are smooth of dimensions $n$ and
$m=n-c$ with $a_Z=a_X\circ i$, so the composition law for the exceptional
inverse image gives

$$
\omega_{Z/k}=Ra_Z^{!}\Lambda_k\ \cong\ Ri^{!}Ra_X^{!}\Lambda_k=Ri^{!}\omega_{X/k},
$$

while [sk-thm-smooth-purity] applied to $a_X$ and to $a_Z$ gives
$\omega_{X/k}\cong\Lambda_X(n)[2n]$ and $\omega_{Z/k}\cong\Lambda_Z(m)[2m]$.

*Step 2: the co-projection removes the twist.* By
[sk-lem-coprojection] with $K=\Lambda_X$ and the invertible
$L=\Lambda_X(n)[2n]$,

$$
Ri^{!}\bigl(\Lambda_X(n)[2n]\bigr)\ \cong\
Ri^{!}\Lambda_X\otimes^{\mathbb L}_{\Lambda_Z}\Lambda_Z(n)[2n].
$$

Combining with Step 1 and cancelling the invertible $\Lambda_Z(n)[2n]$,

$$
Ri^{!}\Lambda_X\ \cong\ \Lambda_Z(m-n)[2m-2n]=\Lambda_Z(-c)[-2c],
$$

and twisting by $(c)[2c]$ (again [sk-lem-coprojection]) gives an
isomorphism $\Phi_i:\Lambda_Z\xrightarrow{\sim}Ri^{!}\Lambda_X(c)[2c]$.
This proves (a): $H^0(Z,Ri^{!}K)=H^0R\Gamma_Z(X,K)$ because $Ri_*Ri^{!}$
is $R\underline\Gamma_Z$, and the construction restricts to every étale
$U\to X$ since $Ru^{!}=u^{*}$ for étale $u$.

*Step 3: the frame class is well defined.* By (a), frame classes are
sections of the sheaf $\mathcal H^0$ on $Z_{\Et}$, so it suffices to compare
two frames $f,f'$ on the same $U$ Zariski-locally. There $f'=Mf$ with
$M\in GL_c(\mathcal O)$, and after shrinking $M$ is a product of diagonal,
permutation and elementary matrices. The argument of [sk-prop-an], Step 3
applies verbatim: a unit $u$ has $\kappa(u)$ defined on all of $U$, so
$\partial\kappa(u)=0$ and $\partial\kappa(uf_j)=\partial\kappa(f_j)$; the
factors $\partial\kappa(f_j)$ have even degree, so permuting them costs no
sign; for a shear $f_1+tuf_2$ the frame over $\Aaf^1_U$ of the pair
$(\Aaf^1\times U,\Aaf^1\times Z_U)$, to which (a) applies, gives a section of
the constant rank-one $\mathcal H^0$ on $\Aaf^1_{Z_U}$, constant along the
line by [sk-prop-a1-inv](i), so its values at $t=0,1$ agree. The sheaf axiom
for $\mathcal H^0$ glues the local frame classes (frames exist locally, $i$
being regular) to a unique global $[Z\subset X]$.

*Step 4: comparison with the smooth-purity isomorphism.* We show
$\Phi_i(1)=[Z\subset X]$; both are sections of $\mathcal H^0$, so this is
étale-local on $X$. Let $z\in Z$, choose a frame $f_1,\dots,f_c$ near $z$
and functions $g_1,\dots,g_m$ near $z$ whose restrictions to $Z$ (smooth by
[sk-lem-regular-smooth]) have differentials forming a basis of
$\Omega_{Z/k}\otimes k(z)$. The conormal sequence
$0\to I/I^2\otimes k(z)\to\Omega_{X/k}\otimes k(z)\to\Omega_{Z/k}\otimes k(z)\to0$
shows that $u=(f,g):U\to\Aaf^c_k\times\Aaf^m_k=\Aaf^n_k$ is étale near $z$,
and $u^{-1}(0\times\Aaf^m_k)=V(f)=Z_U$; call $u':Z_U\to\Aaf^m_k$ the
restriction and $i_0:\Aaf^m_k\hookrightarrow\Aaf^n_k$ the zero section of
$p:\Aaf^c_{\Aaf^m}\to\Aaf^m$.
(i) Since $u,u'$ are étale, $Ri_U^{!}u^{*}=R(u i_U)^{!}=R(i_0u')^{!}=u'^{*}Ri_0^{!}$.
(ii) As $a_U=a_{\Aaf^n}\circ u$ and $a_{Z_U}=a_{\Aaf^m}\circ u'$ with
$\omega_u=\Lambda$, $\omega_{u'}=\Lambda$, compatibility of
[sk-thm-smooth-purity] with composition gives $\Phi_{i_U}=u'^{*}\Phi_{i_0}$.
(iii) On the model, $a_{\Aaf^n}=a_{\Aaf^m}\circ p$ and $p\,i_0=\mathrm{id}$, so by
composition compatibility again $\Phi_{i_0}$ is $Ri_0^{!}$ of the
smooth-purity isomorphism $\Lambda(c)[2c]\cong Rp^{!}\Lambda$ of
[sk-thm-smooth-purity] for $p$, composed with
$Ri_0^{!}Rp^{!}=\mathrm{id}$ (twists passing through $Ri_0^{!}$ by
[sk-lem-coprojection]). By the agreement clause of
[sk-thm-smooth-purity] ($p$ is the projection of a trivial vector bundle;
the clause rests on the normalization of [sk-thm-dnc] in standard
coordinates), that isomorphism is the $R\pi^{!}$-form $\gamma_{p,\Lambda}$
of [sk-prop-an] (ii), and by the normalization [sk-prop-an] (iii),
$Ri_0^{!}\gamma_{p,\Lambda}$ composed with $Ri_0^{!}Rp^{!}=\mathrm{id}$ is the
inverse of the Thom class. Hence $\Phi_{i_0}(1)$ is the generator of
[sk-prop-an] (i),
$\mathrm{pur}_s\boxtimes\cdots\boxtimes\mathrm{pur}_s
=\partial\kappa(t_1)\cup\cdots\cup\partial\kappa(t_c)$ ([sk-prop-an],
Step 1, with [sk-prop-a1]): the class of the coordinate frame.
(iv) Kummer classes, boundaries and cup products with supports commute with
pullback and $u^{*}t_j=f_j$, so $\Phi_i(1)|_{Z_U}=u'^{*}\Phi_{i_0}(1)
=\operatorname{cl}(f)=[Z\subset X]|_{Z_U}$. Such $U$ cover $Z$, hence
$\Phi_i(1)=[Z\subset X]$. As $\Phi_i$ is an isomorphism, $[Z\subset X]$
generates every stalk and $\operatorname{cl}_i=\Phi_i$; this is (b) and (c).

*Step 5: compatibilities.* An étale $X'\to X$ pulls frames back to
frames and frame classes to frame classes, so
$[Z_{X'}\subset X']=[Z\subset X]|_{X'}$, and by (c) $\operatorname{cl}_i$
restricts to $\operatorname{cl}_{i'}$. For products, $Z_1\times_kZ_2$ is smooth
over $k$, and frames $f$ on $U_1$, $g$ on $U_2$ give the frame
$(\mathrm{pr}_1^{*}f,\mathrm{pr}_2^{*}g)$ on $U_1\times_kU_2$, whose class is
$\mathrm{pr}_1^{*}\operatorname{cl}(f)\cup\mathrm{pr}_2^{*}\operatorname{cl}(g)
=\operatorname{cl}(f)\boxtimes\operatorname{cl}(g)$ by naturality and
associativity of supported cup products (no signs, all degrees even);
gluing gives the asserted identity, and by (c) the exterior product of
$\operatorname{cl}_{i_1}$ and $\operatorname{cl}_{i_2}$ is
$\operatorname{cl}_{i_1\times i_2}$.
