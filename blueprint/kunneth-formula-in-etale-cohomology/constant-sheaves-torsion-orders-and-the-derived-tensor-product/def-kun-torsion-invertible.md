For an étale abelian sheaf $F$ and $n\ge1$ write $F[n]=\ker(n:F\to F)$, so
that a torsion sheaf is a sheaf whose local sections are killed by positive
integers. Let $K$ be a field and let
$$
I_K=\{n\ge1:n\cdot1_K\ne0\},
$$
ordered by divisibility; $n\in I_K$ is called *invertible in $K$*.

A torsion sheaf on the étale site of a $K$-scheme has *orders invertible in
$K$* if every element of every geometric stalk is killed by some
$n\in I_K$. For $K$ of characteristic $p>0$ this says the stalks have no
$p$-primary torsion; for $\operatorname{char}K=0$ it is no condition besides
torsion. A complex $K\in D(T_{\Et})$ has *torsion cohomology with orders
invertible in $K$* if every $\mathcal H^q(K)$ has that property.
