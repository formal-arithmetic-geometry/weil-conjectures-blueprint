For every $E\in D(T_{\Et},\Lambda)$, the canonical morphism
$$
\operatorname{hocolim}_{N\to+\infty}\tau_{\le N}E\longrightarrow E
$$
is an isomorphism, where the homotopy colimit is that of
[def-kun-truncations].

## Proof

By [lem-kun-complex-colimit-hocolim] the homotopy colimit is computed by the
termwise colimit of the complexes $\tau_{\le N}E$, and cohomology commutes
with termwise filtered colimits of complexes. For each fixed $q$ one has
$\mathcal H^q(\tau_{\le N}E)=\mathcal H^q(E)$ for all $N\ge q$, so
$\mathcal H^q(\operatorname{hocolim}_N\tau_{\le N}E)=\varinjlim_N\mathcal H^q(\tau_{\le N}E)=\mathcal H^q(E)$.
As this holds for every $q$, the canonical morphism is a quasi-isomorphism,
hence an isomorphism of the derived category.
