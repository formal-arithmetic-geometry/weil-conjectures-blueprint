Let $\Lambda$ be a commutative ring and $T$ a scheme, and work on $T_{\Et}$
with $\Lambda_T$-module sheaves.

1. Every bounded-above complex of flat $\Lambda_T$-module sheaves is K-flat
   [def-kun-derived-tensor].
2. In a distinguished triangle of complexes of $\Lambda_T$-module sheaves,
   if two of the three terms are K-flat then so is the third; in particular
   cones of maps between K-flat complexes are K-flat.
3. Filtered colimits of K-flat complexes are K-flat; in particular every
   bounded-below complex of flat $\Lambda_T$-module sheaves is K-flat.

## Proof

**(1)** Let $\mathcal F^\bullet$ be a bounded-above complex of flat sheaves,
$\mathcal F^i=0$ for $i>N$, and let $\mathcal A^\bullet$ be an acyclic
complex. By descending induction on $N$ we show that
$\mathcal F^\bullet\otimes_\Lambda\mathcal A^\bullet$ is acyclic. The stupid
truncation of [def-kun-truncations] gives a short exact sequence of
complexes
$$
0\to\mathcal F^N[-N]\to\mathcal F^\bullet\to\sigma_{\le N-1}\mathcal F^\bullet\to0,
$$
and tensoring it with $\mathcal A^\bullet$ preserves exactness because it is
exact degreewise (the terms $\mathcal F^i$ are flat); the resulting triangle
shows that the middle term is acyclic whenever the outer two are, by the
long exact cohomology sequence. Now
$\mathcal F^N[-N]\otimes_\Lambda\mathcal A^\bullet$ is a shift of
$\mathcal F^N\otimes_\Lambda\mathcal A^\bullet$, which is acyclic as
$\mathcal F^N$ is flat, and
$\sigma_{\le N-1}\mathcal F^\bullet\otimes_\Lambda\mathcal A^\bullet$ is
acyclic by induction.

**(2)** Tensoring a distinguished triangle with the acyclic complex
$\mathcal A^\bullet$ gives a distinguished triangle; if two of its terms are
acyclic then so is the third, by the long exact cohomology sequence. A cone
is the third term of the triangle determined by the map.

**(3)** Let $\mathcal K^\bullet=\varinjlim_i\mathcal K_i^\bullet$ be a
filtered colimit of K-flat complexes. Filtered colimits of
$\Lambda_T$-module sheaves are exact and commute with tensor products, and
homology commutes with filtered colimits, so for every acyclic
$\mathcal A^\bullet$,
$$
\mathcal K^\bullet\otimes_\Lambda\mathcal A^\bullet=\varinjlim_i\bigl(\mathcal K_i^\bullet\otimes_\Lambda\mathcal A^\bullet\bigr)
$$
is a filtered colimit of acyclic complexes, hence acyclic. A bounded-below
complex $\mathcal F^\bullet$ of flat sheaves is the filtered colimit of its
stupid truncations $\sigma_{\le n}\mathcal F^\bullet$, each of which is
bounded, hence bounded above and flat, hence K-flat by (1).
