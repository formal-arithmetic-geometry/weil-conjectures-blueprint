Let $X$ be a reduced scheme of finite type over a perfect field $K$. For
every field extension $L/K$, the scheme $X_L$ is reduced. Consequently
$X\to\Spec(K)$ is flat and of finite presentation and has geometrically
reduced fibres.

## Proof

Reducedness is local on the target, so let $X=\Spec(A)$ with $A$ a reduced
finitely generated $K$-algebra; then $X_L=\Spec(A\otimes_KL)$. The diagonal
map $A\to\prod_{\mathfrak p}A/\mathfrak p$, the product running over the
finitely many minimal primes, is injective, and $K\to L$ is flat, so
$A\otimes_KL\to\prod_{\mathfrak p}(A/\mathfrak p\otimes_KL)$ is injective; a
subring of a reduced ring is reduced, so it suffices to treat the case where
$A$ is a domain.

Let then $A$ be a domain with fraction field $F$. The extension $F/K$ is a
finitely generated field extension of the perfect field $K$, hence
separable; for a separable field extension $F/K$ and any field extension
$L/K$ the tensor product $F\otimes_KL$ is reduced (the standard criterion
for separable extensions). Since $A\otimes_KL\subseteq F\otimes_KL$ by
flatness of $K\to L$, the ring $A\otimes_KL$ is reduced.

Finally $X\to\Spec(K)$ is flat (every module over a field is flat) and of
finite presentation (as $A$ is a finitely generated $K$-algebra), and its
fibres are the reduced schemes $X_L$ just described.
