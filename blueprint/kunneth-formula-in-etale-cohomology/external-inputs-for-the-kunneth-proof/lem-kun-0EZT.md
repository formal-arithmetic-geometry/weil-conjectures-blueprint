Let $I$ be directed and let
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
X_i&\xleftarrow{\;h_i\;}&Y_i\\
\Big\downarrow{\scriptstyle f_i}&&\Big\downarrow{\scriptstyle e_i}\\
S_i&\xleftarrow{\;g_i\;}&T_i
\end{array}
\qquad(i\in I)
$$
be an inverse system of cartesian squares [def-weil-pbc-cartesian-square]
with affine transition morphisms, where every $g_i$ is quasi-compact and
quasi-separated. Write
$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
X&\xleftarrow{\;h\;}&Y\\
\Big\downarrow{\scriptstyle f}&&\Big\downarrow{\scriptstyle e}\\
S&\xleftarrow{\;g\;}&T
\end{array}
$$
for the limit square. If $(F_i)$ is a compatible system of torsion abelian
sheaves on $T_i$, $F=\varinjlim_ip_i^{-1}F_i$, and if for a fixed $q\ge0$
every base-change map
$$
f_i^{-1}R^qg_{i,*}F_i\longrightarrow R^qh_{i,*}e_i^{-1}F_i
$$
is an isomorphism, then so is
$f^{-1}R^qg_*F\longrightarrow R^qh_*e^{-1}F$.

(*Source:* Stacks Project, [Tag
0EZT](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0EZT), second assertion; the
first assertion of that tag, for sheaves of sets, is not used in this
chapter.) In the Stacks Project this assertion is deduced from Lemma
59.51.8, [Tag 0EYM](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0EYM) (higher
direct images commute with filtered colimits along an inverse system whose
transition morphisms are affine), applied to the two sides of the
base-change map. The torsion hypothesis recorded here is the case used in
this chapter, whose coefficients are $\mathbf Z/n\mathbf Z$-module sheaves.

## Proof

This is the recorded classical input named in the statement, Stacks Project,
[Tag 0EZT](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0EZT), second assertion: a
base-change isomorphism for a fixed cohomological degree passes to the
inverse limit of an inverse system of cartesian squares with affine
transition morphisms. In the Stacks Project it is deduced from Lemma 59.51.8
([Tag 0EYM](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0EYM)), higher direct
images commuting with filtered colimits along such a system. The blueprint
records the torsion case used in this chapter; no separate proof is given.
