Let $K$ be a separably closed field ([def-kun-separably-closed]) and $X$ a
scheme of finite type over $K$. Let $F$ be an abelian sheaf on $X_{\Et}$ whose
support is contained in the set of closed points of $X$. Then $F$ is globally
generated ([def-kun-global-generated]). (*Source:* Stacks Project, Tag
[0F1F](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0F1F), second assertion.)

## Proof

As in the preceding proof, $X$ is Noetherian and
[lem-kun-cp-approximation] gives a presentation $F=\varinjlim_iF_i$ by
finitely generated subsheaves, the support of $F_i$ being a finite set $Z_i$
of closed points of $X$; after giving $Z_i$ its reduced structure,
[lem-kun-04CA] writes $F_i=i_*\mathcal G_i$ for the finite closed immersion
$i:Z_i\to X$.

We claim the evaluation map
$$
 \operatorname{ev}_i:\bigoplus_{s\in H^0(X_{\Et},F_i)}
 \underline{\mathbf Z}\longrightarrow F_i
$$
of [def-kun-global-generated] is surjective. A geometric stalk away from $Z_i$
is zero. At a geometric point over $z\in Z_i$, the finite-direct-image stalk
formula identifies the target with the corresponding stalk of $\mathcal G_i$
on $\Spec(\kappa(z))$. The residue field $\kappa(z)$ is a finite purely
inseparable extension of the separably closed field $K$, hence is separably
closed by [lem-kun-closed-point-field]; therefore
[lem-kun-03QU-global-generation] identifies the sections over the component
$\Spec(\kappa(z))$ with that stalk. Since
$H^0(X_{\Et},F_i)=H^0((Z_i)_{\Et},\mathcal G_i)$ (and $\Gamma$ of a disjoint
union is the product of the global sections), every element of the target
stalk is the germ of a global section, so $(\operatorname{ev}_i)_{\bar z}$ is
surjective. Thus $F_i$ is globally generated in the sense of
[lem-kun-global-generated-stalkwise]. Finally [lem-kun-colim-gbl-gen] shows
that the filtered colimit $F$ is globally generated.
