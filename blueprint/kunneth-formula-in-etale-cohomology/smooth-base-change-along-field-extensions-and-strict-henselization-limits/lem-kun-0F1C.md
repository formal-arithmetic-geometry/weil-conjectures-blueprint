Let $L/K$ be an extension of fields and $g:T\to S$ a quasi-compact and
quasi-separated morphism of schemes over $K$; denote $g_L:T_L\to S_L$ the base
change to $\Spec(L)$. Let $E\in\Dplus(T_{\Et})$ have cohomology sheaves whose
stalks are torsion of orders invertible in $K$, and let $E_L$ be the pullback
of $E$ to $(T_L)_{\Et}$. Then $Rg_{L,*}E_L$ is the pullback of $Rg_*E$ to
$S_L$.

the proof below follows the reduction recorded there.)

## Proof

*Step 1 (reduction to perfect fields).* Let $K'\supseteq K$ and
$L'\supseteq L$ be the perfect closures. The extensions $K'/K$ and $L'/L$ are
purely inseparable, so $\Spec(K')\to\Spec(K)$ and $\Spec(L')\to\Spec(L)$ are
universal homeomorphisms; by the invariance of the small etale topos under
universal homeomorphisms the inverse and direct images of the two squares are
identified under these base changes, so the assertion for $L/K$ is equivalent
to the assertion for $L'/K'$. As $K'$ is perfect, the extension $L'/K'$ is
separable ([def-kun-separably-closed]).

*Step 2 (separable extensions).* By [lem-kun-separable-smooth-colimit] the
field $L'$ is a filtered colimit of finitely generated smooth
$K'$-subalgebras with the inclusions as transition maps, so $\Spec(L')$ is the
inverse limit of the affine smooth $K'$-schemes $\Spec(A_i)$ with affine
transition morphisms; these are quasi-compact and quasi-separated. Apply the
limit form of smooth base change [lem-kun-0F09] with $S=\Spec(K')$,
$S'=\Spec(L')$, the quasi-compact quasi-separated morphism
$g_{K'}:T_{K'}\to S_{K'}$ and the coefficient complex
$E_{K'}\in\Dplus$ whose cohomology sheaves have torsion stalks of orders
invertible in $K'$: it gives
$$
 g_{L'}^{-1}Rg_{K',*}E_{K'}\xrightarrow{\ \sim\ }Rg_{L',*}(g')^{-1}E_{K'},
$$
which is the assertion for the separable extension $L'/K'$, and hence, by Step
1, the assertion for $L/K$.
