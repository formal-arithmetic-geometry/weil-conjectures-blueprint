Let $L$ be a separably closed ([def-kun-separably-closed]) field and
$X=\Spec(L)$. Then every object of the small etale site of $X$ is a disjoint
union of copies of $X$, and for every abelian sheaf $F$ on $X_{\Et}$,
$$
 H^q(X_{\Et},F)=0\qquad(q>0).
$$
Consequently, for every morphism $f:X\to Y$ of schemes, the higher direct
images vanish: $R^qf_*F=0$ for $q>0$.

(*Source:* this is the case of Stacks Project, Tag
[0EZP](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0EZP) that is used in this
chapter, namely the case of the spectrum of a separably closed field; the
general statement of that tag, for an integral normal scheme with separably
closed function field, is not needed here.)

## Proof

*Step 1 (etale $L$-schemes).* An etale morphism is locally of finite
presentation, so an etale $L$-scheme is a disjoint union of affine pieces
which are etale and of finite presentation over $L$, hence etale and of finite
type. An etale finite type scheme over a field is finite over that field, and
a finite etale algebra over a field is a product of finite separable field
extensions; since $L$ is separably closed ([def-kun-separably-closed]) each of
those extensions is $L$ itself. Hence every object of the small etale site of
$X$ is a disjoint union of copies of $X$.

*Step 2 (the global sections functor is exact).* By Step 1 every object of
$X_{\Et}$ is a coproduct of copies of the terminal object $X$, and for a
coproduct the sheaf axiom gives $F(\coprod_jX)\cong\prod_jF(X)$ for a sheaf
$F$. In particular every covering of $X$ contains a summand mapping
isomorphically onto $X$, so a section of a quotient sheaf admits a lift over
$X$: the global sections functor $\Gamma(X_{\Et},-)$ is evaluation at $X$, and
the exactness of the sequence of sheaves gives exactness after evaluation.
Hence $\Gamma(X_{\Et},-)$ is exact, and its derived functors vanish in
positive degrees.

*Step 3 (higher direct images).* Let $U\to Y$ be etale. Then
$X\times_YU\to X$ is etale (base change of an etale morphism), so it is a
disjoint union of copies of $X$ by Step 1, and
$$
 H^q\bigl((X\times_YU)_{\Et},F\bigr)
 =\prod\nolimits_jH^q(X_{\Et},F)=0\qquad(q>0)
$$
by Step 2, cohomology of a disjoint union being the product of the
cohomologies. Hence the presheaf $U\mapsto H^q(X\times_YU,F)$ vanishes for
$q>0$, and therefore so does its sheafification, which is $R^qf_*F$.
