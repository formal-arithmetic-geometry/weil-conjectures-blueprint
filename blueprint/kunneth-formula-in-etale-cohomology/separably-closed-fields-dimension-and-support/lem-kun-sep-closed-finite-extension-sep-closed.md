Let $K$ be a separably closed field and $L/K$ a finite field extension. Then
$L$ is separably closed.

## Proof

Let $M/L$ be a finite separable extension. Its maximal subfield separable
over $K$ is a finite separable extension of the separably closed field $K$,
hence equals $K$; so $M/K$ is purely inseparable by
[lem-kun-sep-closed-finite-extension-purely-inseparable]. A subextension of
a purely inseparable extension is purely inseparable, so $M/L$ is both
purely inseparable and separable, hence trivial: $M=L$. Therefore $L$ has no
nontrivial finite separable extension, that is, $L$ is separably closed by
[def-kun-separably-closed].
