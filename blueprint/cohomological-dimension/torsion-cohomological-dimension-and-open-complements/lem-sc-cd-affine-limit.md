Let $X=\varprojlim_iX_i$ be a filtered inverse limit of quasi-compact
quasi-separated schemes with affine transition maps. If
$\operatorname{cd}_{\rm tor}(X_i)\leq c$ for every $i$, then
$\operatorname{cd}_{\rm tor}(X)\leq c$, with bounds as in
[def-sc-etale-torsion-cd].

## Proof

Let $p_i:X\to X_i$, and first let $F$ be killed by a fixed integer $n>0$. Set
$F_i=p_{i*}F$; for $j\geq i$ the adjunction maps give transition arrows
$p_{ji}^*F_i\to F_j$, and hence arrows $p_i^*F_i\to p_j^*F_j$ on $X$.

The canonical map $\varinjlim_ip_i^*F_i\to F$ is an isomorphism. To verify
it, use quasi-compact étale objects of finite presentation: every such object
and every morphism between two of them descends to a stage of the inverse
system. A section of $F$ on a descended object is, by definition, a section
of $p_{i*}F$ on that object at stage $i$, proving surjectivity locally. If
two representatives agree after pullback, their equality is witnessed on a
finite étale covering; the covering and the finitely many maps in it descend
to a later stage. This proves injectivity after sheafification. These are the
same finite-presentation descent and finite-cover arguments used in the
continuity theorem for étale cohomology.

For each fixed $i$, that theorem gives
$$
H^q(X,p_i^*F_i)=\varinjlim_{j\geq i}H^q(X_j,p_{ji}^*F_i)=0\quad(q>c).
$$
Now apply the compatibility of cohomology with filtered colimits to the
preceding sheaf colimit. Finally remove the fixed exponent using the
expression of a torsion sheaf as a filtered union of its $n$-torsion
subsheaves and the same commutation of cohomology with filtered colimits.
