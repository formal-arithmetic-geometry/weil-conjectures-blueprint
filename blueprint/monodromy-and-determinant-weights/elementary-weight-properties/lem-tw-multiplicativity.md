If $\alpha,\beta$ are eigenvalues of weights $w_1,w_2$ (as in
[def-tw-eigenvalue]), then $\alpha\beta$ has weight
$w_1+w_2$, and $\alpha^{-1}$ has weight $-w_1$ when
$\alpha\neq0$.

## Proof

In the absolute-value convention of [def-tw-eigenvalue] the
absolute value is multiplicative:
$|\alpha\beta|=|\alpha||\beta|=q^{(w_1+w_2)/2}$, and
$|\alpha^{-1}|=|\alpha|^{-1}$; the same holds in every finite extension
and every embedding.
