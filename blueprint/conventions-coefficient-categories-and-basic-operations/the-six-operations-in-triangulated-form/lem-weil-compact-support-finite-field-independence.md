Let $K_0$ be a field, let $X,Y$ be finite-type
[def-weil-scheme-morphism-properties] $K_0$-schemes, let $f:X\to Y$ be a
separated finite-type $K_0$-morphism, fix a prime $\ell$ whose image in $K_0$
is invertible, and fix an algebraic closure $\Qlb$ of $\Ql$. Let
$K_{\Qlb}\in D^b_c(X,\Qlb)$ be an object of the common-stage category of
[def-weil-algebraically-closed-coefficients] represented at the finite
coefficient stages $E\subset L\subset\Qlb$ by $K_E\in D^b_c(X,E)$ and $K_L\in
D^b_c(X,L)$ of [def-weil-rationalization-karoubi]. Then the two objects

$$
 Rf_!K_E\otimes_E\Qlb,\qquad Rf_!K_L\otimes_L\Qlb
$$

of $D^b_c(Y,\Qlb)$, formed from the compact-support functor
[def-weil-integral-rational-qbar-compact-support], are canonically
isomorphic.

## Proof

The scalar-extension functors between the finite stages of
[def-weil-rationalization-karoubi] are exact and compatible with composition
by [lem-weil-scalar-extension-composition], and the finite-stage
compact-support functors of
[def-weil-integral-rational-qbar-compact-support] carry the scalar-extension
isomorphisms supplied by the common-stage construction of
[def-weil-algebraically-closed-coefficients]. By the descent-of-functors
proposition of the proper-base-change chapter the compatible family therefore
descends to a single exact functor on the common-stage category, so its value
on the object $K_{\Qlb}$ is computed indifferently at the stage $E$ or at the
larger stage $L$.
