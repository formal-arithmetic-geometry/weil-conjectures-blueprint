Fix the global finite-field datum, a prime $\ell\ne p$, an integer
$n\geq1$, $A=A_{E,n}$, the algebraically closed field
$k=\overline{\mathbf F}_q$, finite-type $k$-schemes $Y$ and
$\overline X$ with $\dim\overline X\leq d$, and a
proper finite-type morphism
$p:\overline X\to Y$. Let $\mathcal F$ be a sheaf of $A$-modules on
$\overline X_{\Proet}$ that is of étale origin:
$\mathcal F\cong\nu_{\overline X}^*\mathcal G$ for a sheaf
$\mathcal G$ of $A$-modules on $\overline X_{\Et}$. Then the vanishing
required by [def-weil-full-cohomological-dimension] holds for
$\mathcal F$ with the bound $2d$: for every $r>2d$ one has
$\mathcal H^r(Rp_*\mathcal F)=0$, and the same holds for every base change
$V\to Y$ whose source has dimension at most $d$, in particular for
every base change by an étale $Y$-scheme.

## Proof

The morphism $p$ is proper and of finite type, in particular quasi-compact
and quasi-separated, and $\mathcal G$ lies in
$D^+(\overline X_{\Et},A)$, so the comparison direct image of
[prop-weil-pbc-comparison-direct-image] gives

$$
Rp_*\nu_{\overline X}^*\mathcal G\cong\nu_Y^*Rp_{\Et,*}\mathcal G .
$$

By [lem-sf-etale-direct-image-vanishing] the higher direct images of
$p$ on the étale sites vanish above $2d$ for *every* sheaf of
$A$-modules, because $k$ is algebraically closed and
$\dim\overline X\leq d$; that lemma needs no separatedness and no
properness. Hence $\mathcal H^r(Rp_*\mathcal F)=0$ for $r>2d$, which is
the absolute clause of [def-weil-full-cohomological-dimension].
For a base change $V\to Y$ whose source has dimension at most $d$, the
object $V$ of $Y_{\Proet}$ is a weakly étale $Y$-scheme, hence a
scheme, and $p_V:\overline X\times_YV\to V$ is again proper of finite type;
moreover the restriction of $\mathcal F$ to $\overline X\times_YV$ is
the pullback of the étale sheaf
$\mathcal G|_{\overline X\times_YV}$ along the comparison morphism of
$\overline X\times_YV$, by the compatibility of the comparison pullback
with scheme pullback, [lem-weil-pbc-comparison-pullback]. The same
computation therefore applies to $p_V$, with the same bound $2d$, which
is the relative clause.
