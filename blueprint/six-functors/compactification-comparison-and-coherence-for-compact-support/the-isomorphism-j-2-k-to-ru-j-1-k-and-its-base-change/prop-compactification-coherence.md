Let $K_0$ be a field, let $X,Y$ be
finite-type $K_0$-schemes, and let
$f:X\to Y$ be a
separated finite-type
$K_0$-morphism. Fix a prime $\ell$, write $\Ql=\mathbf Q_\ell$, and
require that its image in $K_0$ is invertible. Choose a finite extension
$E/\Ql$, an integer $n\in\mathbf Z_{\geq1}$,
and put $A=A_{E,n}$. The coefficient $A$ is used with the
finite-torsion
constructibility condition. For objects
$c_i=(j_i,\bar f_i)\in\operatorname{Comp}(f)$ in the
compactification category
and a refinement
$u:c_1\to c_2$, the canonical transformation between the
compact-support candidates

$$
R\bar f_{1*,n}j_{1!}
\xrightarrow{\sim}
R\bar f_{2*,n}j_{2!}
$$

is the composite of the proper-composition isomorphism with the isomorphism

$$
Ru_*j_{1!}\xrightarrow{\sim}j_{2!}
$$

on the ambient derived category. These transformations are identities for
identity refinements and are transitive under composition. For any two
compactifications $c_1,c_2$, comparison through a common refinement gives
a natural isomorphism

$$
Rf_{!,n}^{c_1}\xrightarrow{\sim}Rf_{!,n}^{c_2}.
$$

Here $R\bar f_{i*,n}$ and $j_{i!}$ are respectively the
derived direct image and
extension-by-zero functors. A common
refinement may be chosen for any finite collection of
compactifications; the resulting comparison is independent of that choice
and satisfies the cocycle condition for triples of compactifications.
The comparison is asserted on the domain declared in
[def-weil-compact-support-candidate]: the complexes of the pro-etale
site that come from the etale site with an
etale-origin witness. It is
not asserted, and not claimed anywhere in the blueprint, on the whole of
$D(X_{\mathrm{proet}},A)$.

## Proof

We prove coherence on the full subcategory of complexes
$K=\nu_X^*L$ with $L\in D^+(X_{\Et},A)$, using the comparison
pullback of [def-weil-pbc-site-comparison-morphism].
This includes bounded constructible complexes coming from the etale
site. A refinement satisfies $u j_1=j_2$
by [def-weil-compactifications-refinements]. Use the inverse of
the canonical isomorphism of
[lem-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison-proetale]:

$$
\alpha_u^{-1}:Ru_*j_{1!}\xrightarrow{\sim}j_{2!}.
$$

Composition of the derived direct images in
[def-weil-derived-direct-image] gives
$R\bar f_{1*,n}\simeq R\bar f_{2*,n}Ru_*$.
Composing with $R\bar f_{2*,n}(\alpha_u^{-1})$ therefore gives the
claimed map of candidates from [def-weil-compact-support-candidate].
It is the identity for an identity refinement, and the composition law
for $\alpha$ makes these maps transitive.

Finally, [prop-compactification-refinement] gives a common
refinement $d$ of any two compactifications. If
$t_i:Rf_{!,n}^{d}\xrightarrow{\sim}Rf_{!,n}^{c_i}$ are its maps,
the comparison from $c_1$ to $c_2$ is $t_2t_1^{-1}$.
Given another choice $d'$, choose a refinement mapping to both.
The two resulting maps to each $c_i$ can be made equal by the
parallel-refinement clause; do this for the two $c_i$ successively.
Transitivity then makes the two expressions $t_2t_1^{-1}$ equal.
For three compactifications choose one common refinement, so that
$(t_3t_2^{-1})(t_2t_1^{-1})=t_3t_1^{-1}$.
This proves independence and the cocycle condition on the indicated
full subcategory.

The statement on all of $D(X_{\mathrm{proet}},A)$ is no longer part of
the claim: the domain declared in
[def-weil-compact-support-candidate] is the subcategory of complexes
coming from the etale site with a witness, which is exactly the domain on
which the comparison above is proved, so the proposition is complete on its
declared domain. A comparison on complexes without an etale origin would
need proper base change for the complex itself; every proper base-change
statement of the proper-base-change chapter assumes either torsion cohomology and boundedness
below on the etale site or an etale-origin witness, so no such extension is
available, and none is used.
