Let $\Lambda=A_{E,n}$, let $M\in D^b_{ctf}(Y,\Lambda)$ be a
bounded constructible
complex of finite Tor amplitude
on the coefficient site,
and let $\bar y\to Y$ be a
geometric point.
Then $M_{\bar y}\in D(\Lambda)$ is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded
complex of finite free $\Lambda$-modules. The same conclusion
holds on the small etale site with the corresponding constructibility
and derived-tensor
Tor-amplitude conditions.
Separately, for a bounded constructible complex at a
field coefficient stage
$E$, or in the
common-stage
$\Qlb$-category, its geometric stalk is a bounded complex of
finite-dimensional vector spaces over that field and is perfect.

## Proof

Put $C=M_{\bar y}$, using [def-weil-pbc-geometric-stalks].
Constructibility in [def-weil-finite-torsion-constructibility]
makes each $H^r(C)$ finite over $\Lambda$, and only finitely
many are nonzero. Choose $[a,b]$ as in
[def-weil-finite-tor-amplitude]. For an arbitrary
$\Lambda$-module $N$, use its constant sheaf $\underline N$
on $Y$. The exact stalk functor commutes with the
[def-weil-derived-tensor] derived tensor product, so

$$
H^r(C\otimes_\Lambda^L N)
=\mathcal H^r(M\otimes_\Lambda^L\underline N)_{\bar y}=0
\qquad(r\notin[a,b]).
$$

Taking $N=\Lambda$ also gives $H^r(C)=0$ outside $[a,b]$.

The ring $\Lambda=\mathcal O_E/\varpi_E^n$ is Noetherian and local.
Construct a bounded-above finite-free resolution $P^\bullet\to C$
with $P^r=0$ for $r>b$. The construction proceeds downwards:
choose finitely many generators of the highest cohomology, lift
them to cycles, and map a finite free module in that degree to a
representative of $C$. The cone has zero cohomology in that degree
and finitely generated cohomology in lower degrees; Noetherianity
ensures finite generation of the new kernels. Repeating this step
constructs the resolution, which stabilizes in each fixed degree.
Being bounded above and free, $P^\bullet$ is K-flat.

Put $Q=\operatorname{coker}(P^{a-1}\xrightarrow{d^{a-1}}P^a)$.
Since $H^r(P^\bullet)=0$ for $r<a$, the augmented sequence

$$
\cdots\longrightarrow P^{a-2}\longrightarrow P^{a-1}
\longrightarrow P^a\longrightarrow Q\longrightarrow0
$$

is a free resolution of $Q$. Hence, for every $\Lambda$-module
$N$, with no finiteness restriction,

$$
\operatorname{Tor}^{\Lambda}_1(Q,N)
=
\frac{\ker(P^{a-1}\otimes N\longrightarrow P^a\otimes N)}
{\operatorname{im}(P^{a-2}\otimes N\longrightarrow P^{a-1}\otimes N)}
=H^{a-1}(P^\bullet\otimes_\Lambda N)=0.
$$

Thus $Q$ is flat. It is finitely presented, as a cokernel of
finite free modules, so is projective and therefore finite free
over the local ring $\Lambda$. The differential $d^a$ factors
through $Q$, and the quotient map to

$$
0\longrightarrow Q\longrightarrow P^{a+1}
\longrightarrow\cdots\longrightarrow P^b\longrightarrow0
$$

with $Q$ in degree $a$ is a quasi-isomorphism.
This proves the finite-coefficient assertion on either site.

At a field coefficient $F$, the constructible stalk is instead a
bounded complex with finite-dimensional cohomology over $F$.
Splitting cycles and boundaries as vector subspaces gives
$\bigoplus_r H^r(C)[-r]\xrightarrow{\sim}C$, with a finite direct
sum, and proves perfectness directly at the rational stage of
[def-weil-rationalization-karoubi].
For $\Qlb$, choose a finite field of definition from
[def-weil-algebraically-closed-coefficients] and extend this
finite-dimensional complex to $\Qlb$.
