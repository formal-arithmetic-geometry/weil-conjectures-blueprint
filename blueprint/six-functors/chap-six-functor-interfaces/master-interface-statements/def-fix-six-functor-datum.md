Fix the global finite-field datum
$(p,a,q,k_0,k)$, a prime $\ell\neq p$, a finite extension
$E/\Ql$ with valuation ring $\mathcal O_E$ and uniformizer
$\varpi_E$, and $n\in\mathbf Z_{\geq1}$; put
$A=A_{E,n}$ and $\Lambda\in\{A,\mathcal O_E,E,\Qlb\}$, with the
finite-torsion
constructibility, derived
completion, rationalization,
and
common-stage scalar
extension conventions of the preceding sections. Let $X,Y$ be
finite-type $k$-schemes,
let $f:X\to Y$ be a
separated morphism of
finite type, and let $j:U\hookrightarrow X$ be an
open immersion. On the
small pro-etale sites use the
bounded constructible categories $D^b_c(-,\Lambda)$ and the
finite-Tor subcategories
$D^b_{ctf}(-,\Lambda)$. The *six-functor operation datum* of the blueprint
consists of:

1. the derived pullback $Lf^*$, the derived tensor
$-\otimes^L_{\Lambda}-$, and the derived internal Hom
$R\mathcal Hom_{\Lambda}(-, -)$, as in
the derived pullback,
tensor, and internal Hom operations, and the derived direct image
$Rf_*$, as in
the derived direct image;
1. the extension-by-zero functor $j_!$, as in
extension by zero, and the
compact-support direct image $Rf_!$, as in
the compactification
independent compact-support direct image at the finite level and
the integral,
rational, and algebraically closed compact-support functors at the
higher levels, with the compactification-comparison isomorphisms and
the composition law
$R(g\circ f)_!\xrightarrow{\sim}Rg_!Rf_!$ recorded there (the
candidate-level verification of the comparisons for refinements is
[prop-compactification-coherence-detailed]); when $f$ is
proper, the
identification $Rf_!\xrightarrow{\sim}Rf_*$ is
[cor-cbc-proper-coincidence];
1. the exchange transformations $\operatorname{Ex}_*$ and
$\operatorname{Ex}_!$ and the projection transformation
$\operatorname{PF}$, as in
the exchange and projection
transformations;
1. the exceptional inverse image
$$
Rf^!:D^b_c(Y,\Lambda)\longrightarrow D^b_c(X,\Lambda),
$$
the right adjoint of $Rf_!$, as in
the exceptional inverse
image notation, whose existence, interval boundedness, finite-Tor
preservation, and refinement compatibility of units and counits are
the explicit hypothesis
exceptional-adjoint
admissibility;
1. the dualizing objects $\omega_{X,\Lambda}=Ra_X^!\Lambda$ and
the Verdier dual $D_X(-)=R\mathcal Hom_{\Lambda}(-,\omega_{X,\Lambda})$,
formed from the exceptional adjoint and the derived internal Hom already
listed above, whenever the structure morphism is admissible.

This definition names operations and their construction data. It asserts
neither smooth purity nor Verdier biduality. Preservation of the displayed
constructible domains is established by the separate operation theorems;
the adjoint is used only with the stated admissibility hypothesis.
