Let $u:T_1\to T_2$ be proper, let $j_i:X\hookrightarrow T_i$ be
open immersions with $u j_1=j_2$, let $\Lambda$ be a finite ring and
let $K\in D^+(X_{\Et},\Lambda)$, as in
[def-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison], with $V=T_1\times_{T_2}X$,
projections $b:V\to T_1$, $p:V\to X$ and section $s:X\to V$.
Then restriction of
extension by zero along the
clopen section identifies $b^{-1}j_{1!}K$ with $s_!K$, and
restriction of the
derived direct image identifies
$j_2^{-1}Ru_*j_{1!}K$ with $Rp_*b^{-1}j_{1!}K$; consequently the
composite

$$
\theta_{u,K}:j_2^{-1}Ru_*j_{1!}K\xrightarrow{\sim}K
$$

is a specified isomorphism, namely the one used in
[def-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison].

## Proof

By [lem-weil-pbc-proper-open-section] the morphism $s$ is an
open immersion with $ps=\operatorname{id}_X$ and closed image in
$V$, and $b s=j_1$; hence $j_{1!}=b_!s_!$, and the restriction
$b^{-1}b_!$ being the identity for the open immersion $b$, the
restriction of the extension by zero of
[def-weil-pbc-extension-by-zero] gives
$b^{-1}j_{1!}K=s_!K$. Applying
[lem-weil-pbc-derived-open-restriction] to the morphism
$u:T_1\to T_2$, the open immersion $j_2:X\hookrightarrow T_2$ and
the object $j_{1!}K$ of the derived category, the fibre product
there being $V=T_1\times_{T_2}X$ with maps $b$ and $p$,
identifies $j_2^{-1}Ru_*j_{1!}K$ with $Rp_*b^{-1}j_{1!}K$, the
derived direct image being that of
[def-weil-pbc-direct-image]. Substituting the previous
identification gives $j_2^{-1}Ru_*j_{1!}K\cong Rp_*s_!K$, and
[lem-weil-pbc-clopen-section-direct-image] gives
$Rp_*s_!K\cong K$; the composite of these identifications is the
specified isomorphism $\theta_{u,K}$ named in
[def-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison].
