Let $u:T_1\to T_2$ be a
proper morphism between
Noetherian schemes, and $j_i:X\hookrightarrow T_i$
open immersions with
$u j_1=j_2$. Fix a finite coefficient ring
$\Lambda=A_{E,n}$, and a
bounded-below etale complex
$L\in D^+(X_{\Et},\Lambda)$.
Writing $K=\nu_X^*L$ for pullback along
the comparison
morphism, there is a canonical isomorphism on the pro-etale site

$$
j_{2!}K\xrightarrow{\sim}Ru_*j_{1!}K.
$$

Here $j_!$ is
extension by zero and
$Ru_*$ is the
derived direct image.
These maps are the identity for the identity proper map and commute
with composition of proper maps fixing $X$.

## Proof

Apply the exact functor $\nu^*$ from
[thm-weil-pbc-site-comparison] to the etale isomorphism
[lem-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison-iso].
The right side is identified with the pro-etale direct image by
[prop-weil-pbc-comparison-direct-image]; properness gives its
quasi-compact and quasi-separated hypothesis.

For the left side, the comparison morphism in
[def-weil-pbc-site-comparison-morphism] satisfies
$j_{\Et}^{-1}\nu_{T,*}G=\nu_{X,*}j_{\Proet}^{-1}G$:
both evaluate a pro-etale sheaf $G$ on the same etale objects over
the open $X$. Taking left adjoints, using the adjunctions in
[def-weil-pbc-extension-by-zero], [def-weil-extension-by-zero], gives

$$
\nu_T^*j_{\Et,!}\simeq j_{\Proet,!}\nu_X^*.
$$

All these functors are exact, so the identity holds on complexes.
It transports the etale comparison map to the displayed map.
The identifications are natural and commute with composition;
thus [lem-weil-pbc-proper-open-comparison-composition] transports
its identity and composition law as well.
