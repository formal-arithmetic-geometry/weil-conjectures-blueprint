Let $C$ be a smooth curve over a field $k$. Then every local ring
$\mathcal O_{C,P}$ is regular (hence a domain).

## Proof

By definition, a morphism is smooth if and only if it is locally of finite
presentation, flat, and has geometrically regular fibres (the standard
definition of smoothness: the fibres are regular and remain regular after
every base change by a field extension). For the structure morphism
$C\to\operatorname{Spec}k$, this says that each local ring
$\mathcal O_{C,P}$ is geometrically regular over $k$: the ring
$\mathcal O_{C,P}\otimes_kk'$ is regular for every finite extension
$k'/k$. Taking $k'=k$, the ring $\mathcal O_{C,P}$ itself is regular, hence
a domain by [lem-sc-regular-local-domain].
