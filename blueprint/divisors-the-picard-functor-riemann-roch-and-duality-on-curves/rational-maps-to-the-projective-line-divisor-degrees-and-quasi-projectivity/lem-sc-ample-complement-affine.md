Let $X$ be a proper scheme over a field $k$, $D\subseteq X$ an effective
Cartier divisor [def-sc-effective-cartier-divisor] and
$\mathcal L:=\mathcal O_X(D)$ ample. Then $X\setminus D$ is affine.

## Proof

Choose $m\geq1$ with $\mathcal L^{\otimes m}$ very ample and let
$i:X\hookrightarrow\mathbf P^N_k$ be the closed immersion given by the
complete linear system $|\mathcal L^{\otimes m}|$, so that
$i^*\mathcal O(1)\cong\mathcal L^{\otimes m}$ and every global section of
$\mathcal L^{\otimes m}$ is pulled back from a linear form on
$\mathbf P^N$. Let $s=1_D\in H^0(X,\mathcal L)$ be the canonical section,
with $V(s)=D$; then $s^{\otimes m}\in H^0(X,\mathcal L^{\otimes m})$ has
zero locus $D$, and there is a linear form $\ell$ on $\mathbf P^N$ with
$i^*\ell=s^{\otimes m}$. For the hyperplane
$H:=V(\ell)\subset\mathbf P^N$ one has $i^{-1}(H)=V(s^{\otimes m})=D$, so
$$
 i(X\setminus D)=i(X)\cap(\mathbf P^N\setminus H).
$$
The complement of a hyperplane is affine space,
$\mathbf A^N_k\cong\mathbf P^N_k\setminus H$, and
$i(X)\cap\mathbf A^N$ is closed in $\mathbf A^N$, hence affine (a closed
immersion is an affine morphism: *reference: Stacks Project, Morphisms of
Schemes: closed immersions are affine*); therefore $X\setminus D$ is
affine.
