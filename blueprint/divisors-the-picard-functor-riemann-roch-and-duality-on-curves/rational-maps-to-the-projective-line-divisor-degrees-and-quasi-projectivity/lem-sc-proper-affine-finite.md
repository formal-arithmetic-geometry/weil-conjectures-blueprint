Let $C$ be a curve over $k$ which is both proper and affine over $k$. Then
$C$ is finite over $k$ (in particular of dimension zero).

## Proof

Write $C=\operatorname{Spec}B$ with $B$ a $k$-algebra of finite type. If
$B$ were not finite over $k$, then $B$ would contain an element $t$
transcendental over $k$ (a finitely generated $k$-algebra all of whose
elements are algebraic over $k$ is a finite-dimensional $k$-vector space).
The $k$-algebra map $k[x]\to B$, $x\mapsto t$, defines a morphism
$\varphi:\operatorname{Spec}B\to\mathbf A^1_k$. Since
$\operatorname{Spec}B$ is proper over $k$, the image
$Z:=\varphi(\operatorname{Spec}B)$ is a closed subscheme of $\mathbf A^1_k$
which is proper over $k$, by the closed-image lemma of the
ambient-foundations chapter and the proper-image lemma of the quasi-finite
chapter. Now $Z\neq\mathbf A^1_k$: the affine line is not proper over $k$,
because the image of the closed subset
$V(xy-1)\subset\mathbf A^1_k\times_k\mathbf A^1_k$ under the first
projection is $\mathbf A^1_k\setminus\{0\}$, which is not closed. Hence
$Z=V(f)$ for a nonzero $f\in k[x]$, a finite set of closed points. But $Z$
is also the closed subscheme of $\mathbf A^1_k$ cut out by the kernel of
the map $k[x]\to B$, and this kernel contains no nonzero polynomial because
$t$ is transcendental, so $Z=\mathbf A^1_k$, a contradiction. Therefore $B$
is integral over $k$, and being of finite type it is finite over $k$. A
finite $k$-scheme has dimension zero: every quotient of a finite
$k$-algebra is finite over $k$, and a domain finite over the field $k$ is a
field.
