Let $X$ be an integral scheme of finite type over a field $k$ and
$\nu:X^{\nu}\to X$ its normalization in $k(X)$. Then $\nu$ is finite,
surjective and birational; if $X$ is proper then $X^{\nu}$ is proper; and
$\dim X^{\nu}=\dim X$.

## Proof

By construction $\nu$ is affine and dominant, hence surjective (its image
is closed and contains the generic point of $X$). Finiteness: for affine
$X=\operatorname{Spec}A$ (the general case follows by gluing), the
normalization is $\operatorname{Spec}\widetilde A$, where
$\widetilde A$ is the integral closure of $A$ in $k(X)$; we prove that
$\widetilde A$ is a finite $A$-module. If $\dim X=0$ this is clear ($A$ is
Artinian, hence finite over $k$). Assume $\dim X=1$. By Noether
normalization (*reference: Stacks Project, Commutative Algebra, [Tag
00OY](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00OY)*) there is a
transcendental $x\in A$ such that $A$ is finite over $k[x]$; then
$\widetilde A$ equals the integral closure of $k[x]$ in $k(X)$ (the
integral closures of $k[x]\subseteq A$ in their common fraction field
$k(X)$ coincide), and $n:=[k(X):k(x)]<\infty$ (standard field theory:
*reference: Stacks Project, Fields: transcendence degree*). Choose
$b_1,\dots,b_n\in\widetilde A$ forming a $k(x)$-basis of $k(X)$, and choose
$0\neq s\in k[x]$ with $s\,b_ib_j\in\sum_lk[x]b_l$ for all $i,j$ (clearing
the finitely many denominators of the multiplication table). We claim
$\widetilde A\subseteq(1/s)\sum_lk[x]b_l$. For $b\in\widetilde A$, write
$b=\sum_ic_ib_i$ with $c_i\in k(x)$; for every $j$,
$$
 s\,bb_j=\sum_ic_i(s\,b_ib_j)\in\sum_lk[x]b_l,
$$
so $s\,b\,M\subseteq M$ for $M:=\sum_lk[x]b_l$, and since
$1\in M\cap\widetilde A$ we get $s\,b=s\,b\cdot1\in M$, i.e.
$b\in(1/s)M$. Thus $\widetilde A$ is a submodule of the finitely generated
free $k[x]$-module $(1/s)M$; since $k[x]$ is noetherian, $\widetilde A$ is
finitely generated over $k[x]$, hence over $A$. So $\nu$ is finite and
birational. A finite morphism is proper and preserves dimension, so if $X$
is proper then $X^{\nu}$ is proper, and $\dim X^{\nu}=\dim X$.
