Let $X$ be of finite type over $k$, let $j:U\hookrightarrow X$ be an
open immersion, and let $F$
be a constructible
$\Lambda$-sheaf on $U_{{\mathrm{et}}}$. Then $j_!F$ of
[def-weil-pbc-extension-by-zero] is constructible on
$X_{{\mathrm{et}}}$.

## Proof

By [def-weil-pbc-constructible-complexes] $U$ has a finite
partition $U=\bigsqcup_\alpha U_\alpha$ into locally closed
constructible subschemes with $F|_{U_\alpha}$ lisse. The pieces
$U_\alpha$ are locally closed constructible subschemes of $X$ (locally
closed in the open subscheme $U$), and $X$ is the disjoint union of
$X\setminus U$ and the $U_\alpha$. By the stalk description of
[def-weil-pbc-extension-by-zero] the restriction of $j_!F$ to
$U_\alpha$ is the lisse $F|_{U_\alpha}$ and its restriction to
$X\setminus U$ is the zero sheaf, which is lisse; this is the finite
partition with lisse restrictions of
[def-weil-pbc-constructible-complexes].
