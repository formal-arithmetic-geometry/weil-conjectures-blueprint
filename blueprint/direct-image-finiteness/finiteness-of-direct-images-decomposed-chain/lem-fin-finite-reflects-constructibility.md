Let $p:Z\to S$ be a
finite morphism of
Noetherian schemes, let $\Lambda$ be a finite commutative ring, and
let $F$ be an etale sheaf of $\Lambda$-modules on $Z$.
If its direct image $p_*F$ is
constructible, then
$F$ is constructible.

## Proof

At a geometric point $\bar z$, with induced point $\bar s$ of $S$,
the counit has stalk

$$
(p^*p_*F)_{\bar z}
=\prod_{\bar z'\in |Z_{\bar s}|}F_{\bar z'}
\longrightarrow F_{\bar z},
$$

the projection of [lem-weil-pbc-finite-stalk-formula].
It is surjective for modules, hence the counit is surjective by
[lem-weil-pbc-geometric-stalk-conservative].
Pulling back a finite partition and its etale trivializations proves
that $p^*p_*F$ is constructible, by
[def-weil-pbc-constructible-complexes].
Its kernel is constructible by
[lem-weil-pbc-constructible-subobjects-noetherian].
Now take its cokernel using [lem-weil-pbc-constructible-serre].
No surjectivity of $p$ onto $S$ is required.
