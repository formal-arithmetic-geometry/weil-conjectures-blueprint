Let $j:U\hookrightarrow X$ be an
open immersion of
finite-type schemes over a field $k$, and let $F$ be a finite
constructible
$\Lambda$-sheaf with the prime-to-characteristic finite
coefficients of this blueprint.
Every higher direct image
$R^qj_*F$ is constructible, and they vanish for all sufficiently
large $q$. For $q>0$ their restrictions to $U$ vanish.

## Proof

The bounded constructibility assertion is
[cor-fin-deligne-open-finite-coefficients], applied to the sheaf
$F$ in degree zero. To check the support assertion, choose an
injective resolution $F\to I^\bullet$ on $U_{\rm et}$.
The section definition in [def-weil-pbc-direct-image] gives
$j^*j_*I^\bullet=I^\bullet$. Exactness of the inverse image in
[def-weil-pbc-inverse-image] gives
$j^*\mathcal H^q(Rj_*F)=\mathcal H^q(F)=0$ for $q>0$.
